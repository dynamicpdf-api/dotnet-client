His grey eyes shone and twinkled,\nand his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The fire burned\nbrightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the lilies of\nsilver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our glasses. Our\nchairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather than submitted\nto be sat upon, and there was that luxurious after-dinner atmosphere\nwhen thought runs gracefully free of the trammels of precision. And he\nput it to us in this way--marking the points with a lean forefinger--as we\nsat and lazily admired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we\nthought it) and his fecundity.\n\u0060You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two\nideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance,\nthey taught you at school is founded on a misconception.\u0027\n\u0060Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?\u0027 said Filby, an\nargumentative person with red hair.\n\u0060I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground\nfor it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You know of"},{"pageNumber":3,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 2 -\ncourse that a mathematical line, a line of thickness nil, has no real\nexistence. They taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane. These\nthings are mere abstractions.\u0027 \n\u0060That is all right,\u0027 said the Psychologist. \n\u0060Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a real\nexistence.\u0027 \n\u0060There I object,\u0027 said Filby. \u0060Of course a solid body may exist. All real\nthings--\u0027 \n\u0060So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an instantaneous cube\nexist?\u0027 \n\u0060Don\u0027t follow you,\u0027 said Filby. \n\u0060Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real existence?\u0027 \nFilby became pensive. \u0060Clearly,\u0027 the Time Traveller proceeded, \u0060any real\nbody must have extension in four directions: it must have Length,\nBreadth, Thickness, and--Duration. But through a natural infirmity of the\nflesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we incline to overlook\nthis fact. There are really four dimensions, three which we call the three\nplanes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is, however, a tendency to\ndraw an unreal distinction between the former three dimensions and the\nlatter, because it happens that our consciousness moves intermittently in\none direction along the latter from the beginning to the end of our lives.\u0027 \n\u0060That,\u0027 said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight his"},{"pageNumber":4,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 3 -\ncigar over the lamp; \u0060that...very clear indeed.\u0027 \n\u0060Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,\u0027\ncontinued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of cheerfulness.\n\u0060Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension, though some\npeople who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they mean it. It\nis only another way of looking at Time. There is no difference between\ntime and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our\nconsciousness moves along it. But some foolish people have got hold of\nthe wrong side of that idea. You have all heard what they have to say\nabout this Fourth Dimension?\u0027 \n\u0060 I have not,\u0027 said the Provincial Mayor. \n\u0060It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is spoken of\nas having three dimensions, which one may call Length, Breadth, and\nThickness, and is always definable by reference to three planes, each at\nright angles to the others. But some philosophical people have been\nasking why three dimensions particularly--why not another direction at\nright angles to the other three?--and have even tried to construct a Four-\nDimensional geometry. Professor Simon Newcomb was expounding this\nto the New York Mathematical Society only a month or so ago. You\nknow how on a flat surface, which has only two dimensions, we can\nrepresent a figure of a three-dimensional solid, and similarly they think\nthat by models of three dimensions they could represent one of four--if\nthey could master the perspective of the thing. See?\u0027 \n\u0060I think so,\u0027 murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his brows, he\nlapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one who repeats\nmystic words. \u0060Yes, I think I see it now,\u0027 he said after some time,\nbrightening in a quite transitory manner. "},{"pageNumber":5,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 4 -\n\u0060Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometry\nof Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results are curious. For\ninstance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at fifteen,\nanother at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. All these are\nevidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional representations of his\nFour-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and unalterable thing. \n\u0060Scientific people,\u0027 proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause\nrequired for the proper assimilation of this, \u0060know very well that Time is\nonly a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram, a weather\nrecord. This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of the\nbarometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then this\nmorning it rose again, and so gently upward to here. Surely the mercury\ndid not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Space generally\nrecognized? But certainly it traced such a line, and that line, therefore,\nwe must conclude was along the Time-Dimension.\u0027 \n\u0060But,\u0027 said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, \u0060if Time is\nreally only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why has it always\nbeen, regarded as something different? And why cannot we move in\nTime as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?\u0027 \nThe Time Traveller smiled. \u0060Are you sure we can move freely in Space?\nRight and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough, and men\nalways have done so. I admit we move freely in two dimensions. But\nhow about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.\u0027 \n\u0060Not exactly,\u0027 said the Medical Man. \u0060There are balloons.\u0027 \n\u0060But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the\ninequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical movement.\u0027 "},{"pageNumber":6,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 5 -\n\u0060Still they could move a little up and down,\u0027 said the Medical Man. \n\u0060Easier, far easier down than up.\u0027 \n\u0060And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the\npresent moment.\u0027 \n\u0060My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where the\nwhole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the\npresent movement. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and\nhave no dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a\nuniform velocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel\ndown if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth\u0027s surface.\u0027 \n\u0060But the great difficulty is this,\u0027 interrupted the Psychologist. \u0060You can\nmove about in all directions of Space, but you cannot move about in\nTime.\u0027 \n\u0060That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say that\nwe cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an incident\nvery vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: I become absent-\nminded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of course we have no\nmeans of staying back for any length of time, any more than a savage or\nan animal has of staying six feet above the ground. But a civilised man is\nbetter off than the savage in this respect. He can go up against gravitation\nin a balloon, and why should he not hope that ultimately he may be able\nto stop or accelerate his drift along the Time-Dimension, or even turn\nabout and travel the other way?\u0027 \n\u0060Oh, this,\u0027 began Filby, \u0060is all--\u0027 "},{"pageNumber":7,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 6 -\n\u0060Why not?\u0027 said the Time Traveller. \n\u0060It\u0027s against reason,\u0027 said Filby. \n\u0060What reason?\u0027 said the Time Traveller. \n\u0060You can show black is white by argument,\u0027 said Filby, \u0060but you will\nnever convince me.\u0027 \n\u0060Possibly not,\u0027 said the Time Traveller. \u0060But now you begin to see the\nobject of my investigations into the geometry of Four Dimensions. Long\nago I had a vague inkling of a machine--\u0027 \n\u0060To travel through Time!\u0027 exclaimed the Very Young Man. \n\u0060That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time, as the\ndriver determines.\u0027 \nFilby contented himself with laughter. \n\u0060But I have experimental verification,\u0027 said the Time Traveller. \n\u0060It would be remarkably convenient for the historian,\u0027 the Psychologist\nsuggested. \u0060One might travel back and verify the accepted account of the\nBattle of Hastings, for instance!\u0027 \n\u0060Don\u0027t you think you would attract attention?\u0027 said the Medical Man.\n\u0060Our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.\u0027 "},{"pageNumber":8,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 7 -\n\u0060One might get one\u0027s Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,\u0027 the\nVery Young Man thought. \n\u0060In which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go. The\nGerman scholars have improved Greek so much.\u0027 \n\u0060Then there is the future,\u0027 said the Very Young Man. \u0060Just think! One\nmight invest all one\u0027s money, leave it to accumulate at interest, and hurry\non ahead!\u0027 \n\u0060To discover a society,\u0027 said I, \u0060erected on a strictly communistic basis.\u0027 \n\u0060Of all the wild extravagant theories!\u0027 began the Psychologist. \n\u0060Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it until--\u0027 \n\u0060Experimental verification!\u0027 cried I. \u0060You are going to verify that?\u0027 \n\u0060The experiment!\u0027 cried Filby, who was getting brain-weary. \n\u0060Let\u0027s see your experiment anyhow,\u0027 said the Psychologist, \u0060though it\u0027s all\nhumbug, you know.\u0027 \nThe Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly, and\nwith his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly out of the\nroom, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to his\nlaboratory. \nThe Psychologist looked at us. \u0060I wonder what he\u0027s got?\u0027 "},{"pageNumber":9,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 8 -\n\u0060Some sleight-of-hand trick or other,\u0027 said the Medical Man, and Filby\ntried to tell us about a conjurer he had seen at Burslem; but before he had\nfinished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and Filby\u0027s anecdote\ncollapsed. \nThe thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic\nframework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very delicately made.\nThere was ivory in it, and some transparent crystalline substance. And\nnow I must be explicit, for this that follows--unless his explanation is to\nbe accepted--is an absolutely unaccountable thing. He took one of the\nsmall octagonal tables that were scattered about the room, and set it in\nfront of the fire, with two legs on the hearthrug. On this table he placed\nthe mechanism. Then he drew up a chair, and sat down. The only other\nobject on the table was a small shaded lamp, the bright light of which fell\nfull upon the model. There were also perhaps a dozen candles about, two\nin brass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces, so that the\nroom was brilliantly illuminated. I sat in a low arm-chair nearest the fire,\nand I drew this forward so as to be almost between the Time Traveller\nand the fireplace. Filby sat behind him, looking over his shoulder. The\nMedical Man and the Provincial Mayor watched him in profile from the\nright, the Psychologist from the left. The Very Young Man stood behind\nthe Psychologist. We were all on the alert. It appears incredible to me\nthat any kind of trick, however subtly conceived and however adroitly\ndone, could have been played upon us under these conditions. \nThe Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism. \u0060Well?\u0027 said\nthe Psychologist. \n\u0060This little affair,\u0027 said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows upon the\ntable and pressing his hands together above the apparatus, \u0060is only a\nmodel. It is my plan for a machine to travel through time. You will notice\nthat it looks singularly askew, and that there is an odd twinkling"},{"pageNumber":10,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 9 -\nappearance about this bar, as though it was in some way unreal.\u0027 He\npointed to the part with his finger. \u0060Also, here is one little white lever,\nand here is another.\u0027 \nThe Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing. \u0060It\u0027s\nbeautifully made,\u0027 he said. \n\u0060It took two years to make,\u0027 retorted the Time Traveller. Then, when we\nhad all imitated the action of the Medical Man, he said: \u0060Now I want you\nclearly to understand that this lever, being pressed over, sends the\nmachine gliding into the future, and this other reverses the motion. This\nsaddle represents the seat of a time traveller. Presently I am going to\npress the lever, and off the machine will go. It will vanish, pass into\nfuture Time, and disappear. Have a good look at the thing. Look at the\ntable too, and satisfy yourselves there is no trickery. I don\u0027t want to waste\nthis model, and then be told I\u0027m a quack.\u0027 \nThere was a minute\u0027s pause perhaps. The Psychologist seemed about to\nspeak to me, but changed his mind. Then the Time Traveller put forth his\nfinger towards the lever. \u0060No,\u0027 he said suddenly. \u0060Lend me your hand.\u0027\nAnd turning to the Psychologist, he took that individual\u0027s hand in his own\nand told him to put out his forefinger. So that it was the Psychologist\nhimself who sent forth the model Time Machine on its interminable\nvoyage. We all saw the lever turn. I am absolutely certain there was no\ntrickery. There was a breath of wind, and the lamp flame jumped. One of\nthe candles on the mantel was blown out, and the little machine suddenly\nswung round, became indistinct, was seen as a ghost for a second\nperhaps, as an eddy of faintly glittering brass and ivory; and it was gone-\n-vanished! Save for the lamp the table was bare. \nEvery one was silent for a minute. Then Filby said he was damned. "},{"pageNumber":11,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 10 -\nThe Psychologist recovered from his stupor, and suddenly looked under\nthe table. At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully. \u0060Well?\u0027 he said,\nwith a reminiscence of the Psychologist. Then, getting up, he went to the\ntobacco jar on the mantel, and with his back to us began to fill his pipe. \nWe stared at each other. \u0060Look here,\u0027 said the Medical Man, \u0060are you in\nearnest about this? Do you seriously believe that that machine has\ntravelled into time?\u0027 \n\u0060Certainly,\u0027 said the Time Traveller, stooping to light a spill at the fire.\nThen he turned, lighting his pipe, to look at the Psychologist\u0027s face. (The\nPsychologist, to show that he was not unhinged, helped himself to a cigar\nand tried to light it uncut.) \u0060What is more, I have a big machine nearly\nfinished in there\u0027--he indicated the laboratory--\u0060and when that is put\ntogether I mean to have a journey on my own account.\u0027 \n\u0060You mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future?\u0027 said\nFilby. \n\u0060Into the future or the past--I don\u0027t, for certain, know which.\u0027 \nAfter an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration. \u0060It must have gone\ninto the past if it has gone anywhere,\u0027 he said. \n\u0060Why?\u0027 said the Time Traveller. \n\u0060Because I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it travelled into\nthe future it would still be here all this time, since it must have travelled\nthrough this time.\u0027 "},{"pageNumber":12,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 11 -\n\u0060But,\u0027 said I, \u0060If it travelled into the past it would have been visible when\nwe came first into this room; and last Thursday when we were here; and\nthe Thursday before that; and so forth!\u0027 \n\u0060Serious objections,\u0027 remarked the Provincial Mayor, with an air of\nimpartiality, turning towards the Time Traveller. \n\u0060Not a bit,\u0027 said the Time Traveller, and, to the Psychologist: \u0060You think.\nYou can explain that. It\u0027s presentation below the threshold, you know,\ndiluted presentation.\u0027 \n\u0060Of course,\u0027 said the Psychologist, and reassured us. \u0060That\u0027s a simple\npoint of psychology. I should have thought of it. It\u0027s plain enough, and\nhelps the paradox delightfully. We cannot see it, nor can we appreciate\nthis machine, any more than we can the spoke of a wheel spinning, or a\nbullet flying through the air. If it is travelling through time fifty times or\na hundred times faster than we are, if it gets through a minute while we\nget through a second, the impression it creates will of course be only\none-fiftieth or one-hundredth of what it would make if it were not\ntravelling in time. That\u0027s plain enough.\u0027 He passed his hand through the\nspace in which the machine had been. \u0060You see?\u0027 he said, laughing. \nWe sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so. Then the Time\nTraveller asked us what we thought of it all. \n\u0060It sounds plausible enough to-night,\u0027 said the Medical Man; \u0060but wait\nuntil to-morrow. Wait for the common sense of the morning.\u0027 \n\u0060Would you like to see the Time Machine itself?\u0027 asked the Time\nTraveller. And therewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led the way"},{"pageNumber":13,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 12 -\ndown the long, draughty corridor to his laboratory. I remember vividly\nthe flickering light, his queer, broad head in silhouette, the dance of the\nshadows, how we all followed him, puzzled but incredulous, and how\nthere in the laboratory we beheld a larger edition of the little mechanism\nwhich we had seen vanish from before our eyes. Parts were of nickel,\nparts of ivory, parts had certainly been filed or sawn out of rock crystal.\nThe thing was generally complete, but the twisted crystalline bars lay\nunfinished upon the bench beside some sheets of drawings, and I took\none up for a better look at it. Quartz it seemed to be. \n\u0060Look here,\u0027 said the Medical Man, \u0060are you perfectly serious? Or is this\na trick--like that ghost you showed us last Christmas?\u0027 \n\u0060Upon that machine,\u0027 said the Time Traveller, holding the lamp aloft, \u0060I\nintend to explore time. Is that plain? I was never more serious in my life.\u0027 \nNone of us quite knew how to take it. \nI caught Filby\u0027s eye over the shoulder of the Medical Man, and he\nwinked at me solemnly."},{"pageNumber":14,"text":"- 13 -\nThe Time Machine\n2\n- 13 -\nI think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time Machine.\nThe fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who are too clever\nto be believed: you never felt that you saw all round him; you always\nsuspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in ambush, behind his\nlucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and explained the matter in\nthe Time Traveller\u0027s words, we should have shown him far less\nscepticism. For we should have perceived his motives: a pork butcher\ncould understand Filby. But the Time Traveller had more than a touch of\nwhim among his elements, and we distrusted him. Things that would\nhave made the fame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his hands. It is\na mistake to do things too easily. The serious people who took him\nseriously never felt quite sure of his deportment: they were somehow\naware that trusting their reputations for judgment with him was like\nfurnishing a nursery with egg-shell china. So I don\u0027t think any of us said\nvery much about time travelling in the interval between that Thursday\nand the next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in most of our\nminds: its plausibility, that is, its practical incredibleness, the curious\npossibilities of anachronism and of utter confusion it suggested. For my\nown part, I was particularly preoccupied with the trick of the model. That\nI remember discussing with the Medical Man, whom I met on Friday at\nthe Linnan. He said he had seen a similar thing at Tbingen, and laid\nconsiderable stress on the blowing out of the candle. But how the trick\nwas done he could not explain. "},{"pageNumber":15,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 14 -\nThe next Thursday I went again to Richmond--I suppose I was one of the\nTime Traveller\u0027s most constant guests--and, arriving late, found four or\nfive men already assembled in his drawing-room. The Medical Man was\nstanding before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand and his watch\nin the other. I looked round for the Time Traveller, and--\u0060It\u0027s half-past\nseven now,\u0027 said the Medical Man. \u0060I suppose we\u0027d better have dinner?\u0027 \n\u0060Where\u0027s--?\u0027 said I, naming our host. \n\u0060You\u0027ve just come? It\u0027s rather odd. He\u0027s unavoidably detained. He asks\nme in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if he\u0027s not back. Says he\u0027ll\nexplain when he comes.\u0027 \n\u0060It seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,\u0027 said the Editor of a well-known\ndaily paper; and thereupon the Doctor rang the bell. \nThe Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor and myself\nwho had attended the previous dinner. The other men were Blank, the\nEditor aforementioned, a certain journalist, and another--a quiet, shy man\nwith a beard--whom I didn\u0027t know, and who, as far as my observation\nwent, never opened his mouth all the evening. There was some\nspeculation at the dinner-table about the Time Traveller\u0027s absence, and I\nsuggested time travelling, in a half-jocular spirit. The Editor wanted that\nexplained to him, and the Psychologist volunteered a wooden account of\nthe \u0060ingenious paradox and trick\u0027 we had witnessed that day week. He\nwas in the midst of his exposition when the door from the corridor\nopened slowly and without noise. I was facing the door, and saw it first.\n\u0060Hallo!\u0027 I said. \u0060At last!\u0027 And the door opened wider, and the Time\nTraveller stood before us. I gave a cry of surprise. \u0060Good heavens! man,\nwhat\u0027s the matter?\u0027 cried the Medical Man, who saw him next. And the\nwhole tableful turned towards the door. "},{"pageNumber":16,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 15 -\nHe was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and smeared\nwith green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it seemed to me\ngreyer--either with dust and dirt or because its colour had actually faded.\nHis face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown cut on it--a cut half\nhealed; his expression was haggard and drawn, as by intense suffering.\nFor a moment he hesitated in the doorway, as if he had been dazzled by\nthe light. Then he came into the room. He walked with just such a limp\nas I have seen in footsore tramps. We stared at him in silence, expecting\nhim to speak. \nHe said not a word, but came painfully to the table, and made a motion\ntowards the wine. The Editor filled a glass of champagne, and pushed it\ntowards him. He drained it, and it seemed to do him good: for he looked\nround the table, and the ghost of his old smile flickered across his face.\n\u0060What on earth have you been up to, man?\u0027 said the Doctor. The Time\nTraveller did not seem to hear. \u0060Don\u0027t let me disturb you,\u0027 he said, with a\ncertain faltering articulation. \u0060I\u0027m all right.\u0027 He stopped, held out his glass\nfor more, and took it off at a draught. \u0060That\u0027s good,\u0027 he said. His eyes\ngrew brighter, and a faint colour came into his cheeks. His glance\nflickered over our faces with a certain dull approval, and then went round\nthe warm and comfortable room. Then he spoke again, still as it were\nfeeling his way among his words. \u0060I\u0027m going to wash and dress, and then\nI\u0027ll come down and explain things.... Save me some of that mutton. I\u0027m\nstarving for a bit of meat.\u0027 \nHe looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor, and hoped he was\nall right. The Editor began a question. \u0060Tell you presently,\u0027 said the Time\nTraveller. \u0060I\u0027m--funny! Be all right in a minute.\u0027 \nHe put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. Again I\nremarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall, and\nstanding up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out. He had nothing on"},{"pageNumber":17,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 16 -\nthem but a pair of tattered blood-stained socks. Then the door closed\nupon him. I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered how he detested\nany fuss about himself. For a minute, perhaps, my mind was wool-\ngathering. Then, \u0060Remarkable Behaviour of an Eminent Scientist,\u0027 I\nheard the Editor say, thinking (after his wont) in head-lines. And this\nbrought my attention back to the bright dinner-table. \n\u0060What\u0027s the game?\u0027 said the Journalist. \u0060Has he been doing the Amateur\nCadger? I don\u0027t follow.\u0027 I met the eye of the Psychologist, and read my\nown interpretation in his face. I thought of the Time Traveller limping\npainfully upstairs. I don\u0027t think any one else had noticed his lameness. \nThe first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical Man,\nwho rang the bell--the Time Traveller hated to have servants waiting at\ndinner--for a hot plate. At that the Editor turned to his knife and fork\nwith a grunt, and the Silent Man followed suit. The dinner was resumed.\nConversation was exclamatory for a little while, with gaps of\nwonderment; and then the Editor got fervent in his curiosity. \u0060Does our\nfriend eke out his modest income with a crossing? or has he his\nNebuchadnezzar phases?\u0027 he inquired. \u0060I feel assured it\u0027s this business of\nthe Time Machine,\u0027 I said, and took up the Psychologist\u0027s account of our\nprevious meeting. The new guests were frankly incredulous. The Editor\nraised objections. \u0060What was this time travelling? A man couldn\u0027t cover\nhimself with dust by rolling in a paradox, could he?\u0027 And then, as the\nidea came home to him, he resorted to caricature. Hadn\u0027t they any\nclothes-brushes in the Future? The Journalist too, would not believe at\nany price, and joined the Editor in the easy work of heaping ridicule on\nthe whole thing. They were both the new kind of journalist--very joyous,\nirreverent young men. \u0060Our Special Correspondent in the Day after To-\nmorrow reports,\u0027 the Journalist was saying--or rather shouting--when the\nTime Traveller came back. He was dressed in ordinary evening clothes,\nand nothing save his haggard look remained of the change that had"},{"pageNumber":18,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 17 -\nstartled me. \n\u0060I say,\u0027 said the Editor hilariously, \u0060these chaps here say you have been\ntravelling into the middle of next week!! Tell us all about little Rosebery,\nwill you? What will you take for the lot?\u0027 \nThe Time Traveller came to the place reserved for him without a word.\nHe smiled quietly, in his old way. \u0060Where\u0027s my mutton?\u0027 he said. \u0060What a\ntreat it is to stick a fork into meat again!\u0027 \n\u0060Story!\u0027 cried the Editor. \n\u0060Story be damned!\u0027 said the Time Traveller. \u0060I want something to eat. I\nwon\u0027t say a word until I get some peptone into my arteries. Thanks. And\nthe salt.\u0027 \n\u0060One word,\u0027 said I. \u0060Have you been time travelling?\u0027 \n\u0060Yes,\u0027 said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, nodding his head. \n\u0060I\u0027d give a shilling a line for a verbatim note,\u0027 said the Editor. The Time\nTraveller pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and rang it with his\nfingernail; at which the Silent Man, who had been staring at his face,\nstarted convulsively, and poured him wine. The rest of the dinner was\nuncomfortable. For my own part, sudden questions kept on rising to my\nlips, and I dare say it was the same with the others. The Journalist tried to\nrelieve the tension by telling anecdotes of Hettie Potter. The Time\nTraveller devoted his attention to his dinner, and displayed the appetite\nof a tramp. The Medical Man smoked a cigarette, and watched the Time\nTraveller through his eyelashes. The Silent Man seemed even more"},{"pageNumber":19,"text":"The Time Machine H. G.

At last the Time Traveller\npushed his plate away, and looked round us. \u0060I suppose I must apologize,\u0027\nhe said. \u0060I was simply starving. I\u0027ve had a most amazing time.\u0027 He\nreached out his hand for a cigar, and cut the end. \u0060But come into the\nsmoking-room. It\u0027s too long a story to tell over greasy plates.\u0027 And\nringing the bell in passing, he led the way into the adjoining room. \n\u0060You have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine?\u0027 he said\nto me, leaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three new guests. \n\u0060But the thing\u0027s a mere paradox,\u0027 said the Editor. \n\u0060I can\u0027t argue to-night. I don\u0027t mind telling you the story, but I can\u0027t argue.\nI will,\u0027 he went on, \u0060tell you the story of what has happened to me, if you\nlike, but you must refrain from interruptions. I want to tell it. Badly.\nMost of it will sound like lying. So be it! It\u0027s true--every word of it, all\nthe same. I was in my laboratory at four o\u0027clock, and since then...I\u0027ve\nlived eight days...such days as no human being ever lived before! I\u0027m\nnearly worn out, but I shan\u0027t sleep till I\u0027ve told this thing over to you.\nThen I shall go to bed. But no interruptions! Is it agreed?\u0027 \n\u0060Agreed,\u0027 said the Editor, and the rest of us echoed \u0060Agreed.\u0027 And with\nthat the Time Traveller began his story as I have set it forth. He sat back\nin his chair at first, and spoke like a weary man. Afterwards he got more\nanimated. In writing it down I feel with only too much keenness the\ninadequacy of pen and ink--and, above all, my own inadequacy--to\nexpress its quality. You read, I will suppose, attentively enough; but you\ncannot see the speaker\u0027s white, sincere face in the bright circle of the\nlittle lamp, nor hear the intonation of his voice. You cannot know how\nhis expression followed the turns of his story! Most of us hearers were in"},{"pageNumber":20,"text":"H. G.

At first we glanced now and again at\neach other. After a time we ceased to do that, and looked only at the\nTime Traveller\u0027s face."},{"pageNumber":21,"text":"- 20 -\nThe Time Machine\n3\n- 20 -\n\u0060I told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the Time Machine,\nand showed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in the workshop.\nThere it is now, a little travel-worn, truly; and one of the ivory bars is\ncracked, and a brass rail bent; but the rest of it\u0027s sound enough. I\nexpected to finish it on Friday; but on Friday, when the putting together\nwas nearly done, I found that one of the nickel bars was exactly one inch\ntoo short, and this I had to get remade; so that the thing was not complete\nuntil this morning. It was at ten o\u0027clock to-day that the first of all Time\nMachines began its career. I gave it a last tap, tried all the screws again,\nput one more drop of oil on the quartz rod, and sat myself in the saddle. I\nsuppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same\nwonder at what will come next as I felt then. I took the starting lever in\none hand and the stopping one in the other, pressed the first, and almost\nimmediately the second. I seemed to reel; I felt a nightmare sensation of\nfalling; and, looking round, I saw the laboratory exactly as before. Had\nanything happened? For a moment I suspected that my intellect had\ntricked me. Then I noted the clock. A moment before, as it seemed, it had\nstood at a minute or so past ten; now it was nearly half-past three! \n\u0060I drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with both hands,\nand went off with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went dark. Mrs.\nWatchett came in and walked, apparently without seeing me, towards the"},{"pageNumber":22,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 21 -\ngarden door. I suppose it took her a minute or so to traverse the place,\nbut to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket. I pressed the\nlever over to its extreme position. The night came like the turning out of\na lamp, and in another moment came to-morrow. The laboratory grew\nfaint and hazy, then fainter and ever fainter. To-morrow night came\nblack, then day again, night again, day again, faster and faster still. An\neddying murmur filled my ears, and a strange, dumb confusedness\ndescended on my mind. \n\u0060I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time travelling.\nThey are excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling exactly like that one\nhas upon a switchback--of a helpless headlong motion! I felt the same\nhorrible anticipation, too, of an imminent smash. As I put on pace, night\nfollowed day like the flapping of a black wing. The dim suggestion of the\nlaboratory seemed presently to fall away from me, and I saw the sun\nhopping swiftly across the sky, leaping it every minute, and every minute\nmarking a day. I supposed the laboratory had been destroyed and I had\ncome into the open air. I had a dim impression of scaffolding, but I was\nalready going too fast to be conscious of any moving things. The slowest\nsnail that ever crawled dashed by too fast for me. The twinkling\nsuccession of darkness and light was excessively painful to the eye.\nThen, in the intermittent darknesses, I saw the moon spinning swiftly\nthrough her quarters from new to full, and had a faint glimpse of the\ncircling stars. Presently, as I went on, still gaining velocity, the\npalpitation of night and day merged into one continuous greyness; the\nsky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a splendid luminous color like\nthat of early twilight; the jerking sun became a streak of fire, a brilliant\narch, in space; the moon a fainter fluctuating band; and I could see\nnothing of the stars, save now and then a brighter circle flickering in the\nblue. \n\u0060The landscape was misty and vague. I was still on the hill-side upon"},{"pageNumber":23,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 22 -\nwhich this house now stands, and the shoulder rose above me grey and\ndim. I saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour, now brown,\nnow green; they grew, spread, shivered, and passed away. I saw huge\nbuildings rise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams. The whole surface\nof the earth seemed changed--melting and flowing under my eyes. The\nlittle hands upon the dials that registered my speed raced round faster and\nfaster. Presently I noted that the sun belt swayed up and down, from\nsolstice to solstice, in a minute or less, and that consequently my pace\nwas over a year a minute; and minute by minute the white snow flashed\nacross the world, and vanished, and was followed by the bright, brief\ngreen of spring. \n\u0060The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now. They\nmerged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked indeed a\nclumsy swaying of the machine, for which I was unable to account. But\nmy mind was too confused to attend to it, so with a kind of madness\ngrowing upon me, I flung myself into futurity. At first I scarce thought of\nstopping, scarce thought of anything but these new sensations. But\npresently a fresh series of impressions grew up in my mind--a certain\ncuriosity and therewith a certain dread--until at last they took complete\npossession of me. What strange developments of humanity, what\nwonderful advances upon our rudimentary civilisation, I thought, might\nnot appear when I came to look nearly into the dim elusive world that\nraced and fluctuated before my eyes! I saw great and splendid\narchitecture rising about me, more massive than any buildings of our\nown time, and yet, as it seemed, built of glimmer and mist. I saw a richer\ngreen flow up the hill-side, and remain there, without any wintry\nintermission. Even through the veil of my confusion the earth seemed\nvery fair. And so my mind came round to the business of stopping, \n\u0060The peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some substance in\nthe space which I, or the machine, occupied. So long as I travelled at a"},{"pageNumber":24,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 23 -\nhigh velocity through time, this scarcely mattered; I was, so to speak,\nattenuated--was slipping like a vapour through the interstices of\nintervening substances! But to come to a stop involved the jamming of\nmyself, molecule by molecule, into whatever lay in my way; meant\nbringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the obstacle\nthat a profound chemical reaction--possibly a far-reaching explosion--\nwould result, and blow myself and my apparatus out of all possible\ndimensions--into the Unknown. This possibility had occurred to me\nagain and again while I was making the machine; but then I had\ncheerfully accepted it as an unavoidable risk--one of the risks a man has\ngot to take! Now the risk was inevitable, I no longer saw it in the same\ncheerful light. The fact is that insensibly, the absolute strangeness of\neverything, the sickly jarring and swaying of the machine, above all, the\nfeeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely upset my nerve. I told myself\nthat I could never stop, and with a gust of petulance I resolved to stop\nforthwith. Like an impatient fool, I lugged over the lever, and\nincontinently the thing went reeling over, and I was flung headlong\nthrough the air. \n\u0060There was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears. I may have been\nstunned for a moment. A pitiless hail was hissing round me, and I was\nsitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine. Everything still\nseemed grey, but presently I remarked that the confusion in my ears was\ngone. I looked round me. I was on what seemed to be a little lawn in a\ngarden, surrounded by rhododendron bushes, and I noticed that their\nmauve and purple blossoms were dropping in a shower under the beating\nof the hailstones. The rebounding, dancing hail hung in a cloud over the\nmachine, and drove along the ground like smoke. In a moment I was wet\nto the skin. \u0022Fine hospitality,\u0022 said I, \u0022to a man who has travelled\ninnumerable years to see you.\u0022 \n\u0060Presently I thought what a fool I was to get wet. I stood up and looked"},{"pageNumber":25,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 24 -\nround me. A colossal figure, carved apparently in some white stone,\nloomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy\ndownpour. But all else of the world was invisible. \n\u0060My sensations would be hard to describe. As the columns of hail grew\nthinner, I saw the white figure more distinctly. It was very large, for a\nsilver birch-tree touched its shoulder. It was of white marble, in shape\nsomething like a winged sphinx, but the wings, instead of being carried\nvertically at the sides, were spread so that it seemed to hover. The\npedestal, it appeared to me, was of bronze, and was thick with verdigris.\nIt chanced that the face was towards me; the sightless eyes seemed to\nwatch me; there was the faint shadow of a smile on the lips. It was\ngreatly weather-worn, and that imparted an unpleasant suggestion of\ndisease. I stood looking at it for a little space--half a minute, perhaps, or\nhalf an hour. It seemed to advance and to recede as the hail drove before\nit denser or thinner. At last I tore my eyes from it for a moment and saw\nthat the hail curtain had worn threadbare, and that the sky was lightening\nwith the promise of the sun. \n\u0060I looked up again at the crouching white shape, and the full temerity of\nmy voyage came suddenly upon me. What might appear when that hazy\ncurtain was altogether withdrawn? What might not have happened to\nmen? What if cruelty had grown into a common passion? What if in this\ninterval the race had lost its manliness and had developed into something\ninhuman, unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly powerful? I might seem\nsome old-world savage animal, only the more dreadful and disgusting for\nour common likeness--a foul creature to be incontinently slain. \n\u0060Already I saw other vast shapes--huge buildings with intricate parapets\nand tall columns, with a wooded hillside dimly creeping in upon me\nthrough the lessening storm. I was seized with a panic fear. I turned\nfrantically to the Time Machine, and strove hard to readjust it. As I did"},{"pageNumber":26,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 25 -\nso the shafts of the sun smote through the thunderstorm. The grey\ndownpour was swept aside and vanished like the trailing garments of a\nghost. Above me, in the intense blue of the summer sky, some faint\nbrown shreds of cloud whirled into nothingness. The great buildings\nabout me stood out clear and distinct, shining with the wet of the\nthunderstorm, and picked out in white by the unmelted hailstones piled\nalong their courses. I felt naked in a strange world. I felt as perhaps a\nbird may feel in the clear air, knowing the hawk wings above and will\nswoop. My fear grew to frenzy. I took a breathing space, set my teeth,\nand again grappled fiercely, wrist and knee, with the machine. It gave\nunder my desperate onset and turned over. It struck my chin violently.\nOne hand on the saddle, the other on the lever, I stood panting heavily in\nattitude to mount again. \n\u0060But with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered. I\nlooked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote\nfuture. In a circular opening, high up in the wall of the nearer house, I\nsaw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes. They had seen me, and\ntheir faces were directed towards me. \n\u0060Then I heard voices approaching me. Coming through the bushes by the\nWhite Sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running. One of\nthese emerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon which\nI stood with my machine. He was a slight creature--perhaps four feet\nhigh--clad in a purple tunic, girdled at the waist with a leather belt.\nSandals or buskins--I could not clearly distinguish which--were on his\nfeet; his legs were bare to the knees, and his head was bare. Noticing\nthat, I noticed for the first time how warm the air was. \n\u0060He struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, but\nindescribably frail. His flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful\nkind of consumptive--that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so"},{"pageNumber":27,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 26 -\nmuch. At the sight of him I suddenly regained confidence. I took my\nhands from the machine."},{"pageNumber":28,"text":"- 27 -\nThe Time Machine\n4\n- 27 -\n\u0060In another moment we were standing face to face, I and this fragile thing\nout of futurity. He came straight up to me and laughed into my eyes. The\nabsence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at once. Then he\nturned to the two others who were following him and spoke to them in a\nstrange and very sweet and liquid tongue. \n\u0060There were others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps eight\nor ten of these exquisite creatures were about me. One of them addressed\nme. It came into my head, oddly enough, that my voice was too harsh\nand deep for them. So I shook my head, and, pointing to my ears, shook\nit again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and then touched my hand.\nThen I felt other soft little tentacles upon my back and shoulders. They\nwanted to make sure I was real. There was nothing in this at all alarming.\nIndeed, there was something in these pretty little people that inspired\nconfidence--a graceful gentleness, a certain childlike ease. And besides,\nthey looked so frail that I could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of\nthem about like nine-pins. But I made a sudden motion to warn them\nwhen I saw their little pink hands feeling at the Time Machine. Happily\nthen, when it was not too late, I thought of a danger I had hitherto\nforgotten, and reaching over the bars of the machine I unscrewed the\nlittle levers that would set it in motion, and put these in my pocket. Then\nI turned again to see what I could do in the way of communication. "},{"pageNumber":29,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 28 -\n\u0060And then, looking more nearly into their features, I saw some further\npeculiarities in their Dresden china type of prettiness. Their hair, which\nwas uniformly curly, came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek; there\nwas not the faintest suggestion of it on the face, and their ears were\nsingularly minute. The mouths were small, with bright red, rather thin\nlips, and the little chins ran to a point. The eyes were large and mild;\nand--this may seem egotism on my part--I fancied even that there was a\ncertain lack of the interest I might have expected in them. \n\u0060As they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stood\nround me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, I\nbegan the conversation. I pointed to the Time Machine and to myself.\nThen hesitating for a moment how to express time, I pointed to the sun.\nAt once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and white\nfollowed my gesture, and then astonished me by imitating the sound of\nthunder. \n\u0060For a moment I was staggered, though the import of his gesture was\nplain enough. The question had come into my mind abruptly: were these\ncreatures fools? You may hardly understand how it took me. You see I\nhad always anticipated that the people of the year Eight Hundred and\nTwo Thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in knowledge, art,\neverything. Then one of them suddenly asked me a question that showed\nhim to be on the intellectual level of one of our five-year-old children--\nasked me, in fact, if I had come from the sun in a thunderstorm! It let\nloose the judgment I had suspended upon their clothes, their frail light\nlimbs, and fragile features. A flow of disappointment rushed across my\nmind. For a moment I felt that I had built the Time Machine in vain. \n\u0060I nodded, pointed to the sun, and gave them such a vivid rendering of a\nthunderclap as startled them. They all withdrew a pace or so and bowed.\nThen came one laughing towards me, carrying a chain of beautiful"},{"pageNumber":30,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 29 -\nflowers altogether new to me, and put it about my neck. The idea was\nreceived with melodious applause; and presently they were all running to\nand fro for flowers, and laughingly flinging them upon me until I was\nalmost smothered with blossom. You who have never seen the like can\nscarcely imagine what delicate and wonderful flowers countless years of\nculture had created. Then someone suggested that their plaything should\nbe exhibited in the nearest building, and so I was led past the sphinx of\nwhite marble, which had seemed to watch me all the while with a smile\nat my astonishment, towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone. As I\nwent with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a\nprofoundly grave and intellectual posterity came, with irresistible\nmerriment, to my mind. \n\u0060The building had a huge entry, and was altogether of colossal\ndimensions. I was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of\nlittle people, and with the big open portals that yawned before me\nshadowy and mysterious. My general impression of the world I saw over\ntheir heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and flowers, a long-\nneglected and yet weedless garden. I saw a number of tall spikes of\nstrange white flowers, measuring a foot perhaps across the spread of the\nwaxen petals. They grew scattered, as if wild, among the variegated\nshrubs, but, as I say, I did not examine them closely at this time. The\nTime Machine was left deserted on the turf among the rhododendrons. \n\u0060The arch of the doorway was richly carved, but naturally I did not\nobserve the carving very narrowly, though I fancied I saw suggestions of\nold Phoenician decorations as I passed through, and it struck me that they\nwere very badly broken and weather-worn. Several more brightly clad\npeople met me in the doorway, and so we entered, I, dressed in dingy\nnineteenth-century garments, looking grotesque enough, garlanded with\nflowers, and surrounded by an eddying mass of bright, soft-colored robes\nand shining white limbs, in a melodious whirl of laughter and laughing"},{"pageNumber":31,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 30 -\nspeech. \n\u0060The big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with\nbrown. The roof was in shadow, and the windows, partially glazed with\ncoloured glass and partially unglazed, admitted a tempered light. The\nfloor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white metal, not\nplates nor slabs--blocks, and it was so much worn, as I judged by the\ngoing to and fro of past generations, as to be deeply channelled along the\nmore frequented ways. Transverse to the length were innumerable tables\nmade of slabs of polished stone, raised perhaps a foot from the floor, and\nupon these were heaps of fruits. Some I recognized as a kind of\nhypertrophied raspberry and orange, but for the most part they were\nstrange. \n\u0060Between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions. Upon\nthese my conductors seated themselves, signing for me to do likewise.\nWith a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the fruit with their\nhands, flinging peel and stalks, and so forth, into the round openings in\nthe sides of the tables. I was not loath to follow their example, for I felt\nthirsty and hungry. As I did so I surveyed the hall at my leisure. \n\u0060And perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look. The\nstained-glass windows, which displayed only a geometrical pattern, were\nbroken in many places, and the curtains that hung across the lower end\nwere thick with dust. And it caught my eye that the corner of the marble\ntable near me was fractured. Nevertheless, the general effect was\nextremely rich and picturesque. There were, perhaps, a couple of\nhundred people dining in the hall, and most of them, seated as near to me\nas they could come, were watching me with interest, their little eyes\nshining over the fruit they were eating. All were clad in the same soft and\nyet strong, silky material. "},{"pageNumber":32,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 31 -\n\u0060Fruit, by the by, was all their diet. These people of the remote future\nwere strict vegetarians, and while I was with them, in spite of some\ncarnal cravings, I had to be frugivorous also. Indeed, I found afterwards\nthat horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, had followed the Ichthyosaurus into\nextinction. But the fruits were very delightful; one, in particular, that\nseemed to be in season all the time I was there--a floury thing in a three-\nsided husk--was especially good, and I made it my staple. At first I was\npuzzled by all these strange fruits, and by the strange flowers I saw, but\nlater I began to perceive their import. \n\u0060However, I am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future now.\nSo soon as my appetite was a little checked, I determined to make a\nresolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of mine. Clearly\nthat was the next thing to do. The fruits seemed a convenient thing to\nbegin upon, and holding one of these up I began a series of interrogative\nsounds and gestures. I had some considerable difficulty in conveying my\nmeaning. At first my efforts met with a stare of surprise or\ninextinguishable laughter, but presently a fair-haired little creature\nseemed to grasp my intention and repeated a name. They had to chatter\nand explain the business at great length to each other, and my first\nattempts to make the exquisite little sounds of their language caused an\nimmense amount of amusement. However, I felt like a schoolmaster\namidst children, and persisted, and presently I had a score of noun\nsubstantives at least at my command; and then I got to demonstrative\npronouns, and even the verb \u0022to eat.\u0022 But it was slow work, and the little\npeople soon tired and wanted to get away from my interrogations, so I\ndetermined, rather of necessity, to let them give their lessons in little\ndoses when they felt inclined. And very little doses I found they were\nbefore long, for I never met people more indolent or more easily\nfatigued. \n\u0060A queer thing I soon discovered about my little hosts, and that was their"},{"pageNumber":33,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 32 -\nlack of interest. They would come to me with eager cries of\nastonishment, like children, but like children they would soon stop\nexamining me and wander away after some other toy. The dinner and my\nconversational beginnings ended, I noted for the first time that almost all\nthose who had surrounded me at first were gone. It is odd, too, how\nspeedily I came to disregard these little people. I went out through the\nportal into the sunlit world again as soon as my hunger was satisfied. I\nwas continually meeting more of these men of the future, who would\nfollow me a little distance, chatter and laugh about me, and, having\nsmiled and gesticulated in a friendly way, leave me again to my own\ndevices. \n\u0060The calm of evening was upon the world as I emerged from the great\nhall, and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun. At first\nthings were very confusing. Everything was so entirely different from the\nworld I had known--even the flowers. The big building I had left was\nsituated on the slope of a broad river valley, but the Thames had shifted,\nperhaps, a mile from its present position. I resolved to mount to the\nsummit of a crest perhaps a mile and a half away, from which I could get\na wider view of this our planet in the year Eight Hundred and Two\nThousand Seven Hundred and One A.D. For that, I should explain, was\nthe date the little dials of my machine recorded. \n\u0060As I walked I was watching for every impression that could possibly\nhelp to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which I found the\nworld--for ruinous it was. A little way up the hill, for instance, was a\ngreat heap of granite, bound together by masses of aluminium, a vast\nlabyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled heaps, amidst which were\nthick heaps of very beautiful pagoda-like plants--nettles possibly--but\nwonderfully tinted with brown about the leaves, and incapable of\nstinging. It was evidently the derelict remains of some vast structure, to\nwhat end built I could not determine. It was here that I was destined, at a"},{"pageNumber":34,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 33 -\nlater date, to have a very strange experience--the first intimation of a still\nstranger discovery--but of that I will speak in its proper place. \n\u0060Looking round with a sudden thought, from a terrace on which I rested\nfor a while, I realized that there were no small houses to be seen.\nApparently the single house, and possibly even the household, had\nvanished. Here and there among the greenery were palace-like buildings,\nbut the house and the cottage, which form such characteristic features of\nour own English landscape, had disappeared. \n\u0060\u0022Communism,\u0022 said I to myself. \n\u0060And on the heels of that came another thought. I looked at the half-\ndozen little figures that were following me. Then, in a flash, I perceived\nthat all had the same form of costume, the same soft hairless visage, and\nthe same girlish rotundity of limb. It may seem strange, perhaps, that I\nhad not noticed this before. But everything was so strange. Now, I saw\nthe fact plainly enough. In costume, and in all the differences of texture\nand bearing that now mark off the sexes from each other, these people of\nthe future were alike. And the children seemed to my eyes to be but the\nminiatures of their parents. I judged, then, that the children of that time\nwere extremely precocious, physically at least, and I found afterwards\nabundant verification of my opinion. \n\u0060Seeing the ease and security in which these people were living, I felt\nthat this close resemblance of the sexes was after all what one would\nexpect; for the strength of a man and the softness of a woman, the\ninstitution of the family, and the differentiation of occupations are mere\nmilitant necessities of an age of physical force. Where population is\nbalanced and abundant, much childbearing becomes an evil rather than a\nblessing to the State; where violence comes but rarely and offspring are"},{"pageNumber":35,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 34 -\nsecure, there is less necessity--indeed there is no necessity--for an\nefficient family, and the specialization of the sexes with reference to their\nchildren\u0027s needs disappears. We see some beginnings of this even in our\nown time, and in this future age it was complete. This, I must remind\nyou, was my speculation at the time. Later, I was to appreciate how far it\nfell short of the reality. \n\u0060While I was musing upon these things, my attention was attracted by a\npretty little structure, like a well under a cupola. I thought in a transitory\nway of the oddness of wells still existing, and then resumed the thread of\nmy speculations. There were no large buildings towards the top of the\nhill, and as my walking powers were evidently miraculous, I was\npresently left alone for the first time. With a strange sense of freedom\nand adventure I pushed on up to the crest. \n\u0060There I found a seat of some yellow metal that I did not recognize,\ncorroded in places with a kind of pinkish rust and half smothered in soft\nmoss, the armrests cast and filed into the resemblance of griffins\u0027 heads. I\nsat down on it, and I surveyed the broad view of our old world under the\nsunset of that long day. It was as sweet and fair a view as I have ever\nseen. The sun had already gone below the horizon and the west was\nflaming gold, touched with some horizontal bars of purple and crimson.\nBelow was the valley of the Thames, in which the river lay like a band of\nburnished steel. I have already spoken of the great palaces dotted about\namong the variegated greenery, some in ruins and some still occupied.\nHere and there rose a white or silvery figure in the waste garden of the\nearth, here and there came the sharp vertical line of some cupola or\nobelisk. There were no hedges, no signs of proprietary rights, no\nevidences of agriculture; the whole earth had become a garden. \n\u0060So watching, I began to put my interpretation upon the things I had\nseen, and as it shaped itself to me that evening, my interpretation was"},{"pageNumber":36,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 35 -\nsomething in this way. (Afterwards I found I had got only a half-truth--or\nonly a glimpse of one facet of the truth.) \n\u0060It seemed to me that I had happened upon humanity upon the wane. The\nruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind. For the first time\nI began to realize an odd consequence of the social effort in which we are\nat present engaged. And yet, come to think, it is a logical consequence\nenough. Strength is the outcome of need; security sets a premium on\nfeebleness. The work of ameliorating the conditions of life--the true\ncivilising process that makes life more and more secure--had gone\nsteadily on to a climax. One triumph of a united humanity over Nature\nhad followed another. Things that are now mere dreams had become\nprojects deliberately put in hand and carried forward. And the harvest\nwas what I saw! \n\u0060After all, the sanitation and the agriculture of to-day are still in the\nrudimentary stage. The science of our time has attacked but a little\ndepartment of the field of human disease, but, even so, it spreads its\noperations very steadily and persistently. Our agriculture and horticulture\ndestroy a weed just here and there and cultivate perhaps a score or so of\nwholesome plants, leaving the greater number to fight out a balance as\nthey can. We improve our favourite plants and animals--and how few\nthey are--gradually by selective breeding; now a new and better peach,\nnow a seedless grape, now a sweeter and larger flower, now a more\nconvenient breed of cattle. We improve them gradually, because our\nideals are vague and tentative, and our knowledge is very limited;\nbecause Nature, too, is shy and slow in our clumsy hands. Some day all\nthis will be better organized, and still better. That is the drift of the\ncurrent in spite of the eddies. The whole world will be intelligent,\neducated, and co-operating; things will move faster and faster towards\nthe subjugation of Nature. In the end, wisely and carefully we shall\nreadjust the balance of animal and vegetable me to suit our human needs. "},{"pageNumber":37,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 36 -\n\u0060This adjustment, I say, must have been done, and done well; done\nindeed for all Time, in the space of Time across which my machine had\nleaped. The air was free from gnats, the earth from weeds or fungi;\neverywhere were fruits and sweet and delightful flowers; brilliant\nbutterflies flew hither and thither. The ideal of preventive medicine was\nattained. Diseases had been stamped out. I saw no evidence of any\ncontagious diseases during all my stay. And I shall have to tell you later\nthat even the processes of putrefaction and decay had been profoundly\naffected by these changes. \n\u0060Social triumphs, too, had been effected. I saw mankind housed in\nsplendid shelters, gloriously clothed, and as yet I had found them\nengaged in no toil. There were no signs of struggle, neither social nor\neconomical struggle. The shop, the advertisement, traffic, all that\ncommerce which constitutes the body of our world, was gone. It was\nnatural on that golden evening that I should jump at the idea of a social\nparadise. The difficulty of increasing population had been met, I guessed,\nand population had ceased to increase. \n\u0060But with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to the\nchange. What, unless biological science is a mass of errors, is the cause\nof human intelligence and vigour? Hardship and freedom: conditions\nunder which the active, strong, and subtle survive and the weaker go to\nthe wall; conditions that put a premium upon the loyal alliance of capable\nmen, upon self-restraint, patience, and decision. And the institution of the\nfamily, and the emotions that arise therein, the fierce jealousy, the\ntenderness for offspring, parental self-devotion, all found their\njustification and support in the imminent dangers of the young. Now,\nwhere are these imminent dangers? There is a sentiment arising, and it\nwill grow, against connubial jealousy, against fierce maternity, against\npassion of all sorts; unnecessary things now, and things that make us\nuncomfortable, savage survivals, discords in a refined and pleasant life. "},{"pageNumber":38,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 37 -\n\u0060I thought of the physical slightness of the people, their lack of\nintelligence, and those big abundant ruins, and it strengthened my belief\nin a perfect conquest of Nature. For after the battle comes Quiet.\nHumanity had been strong, energetic, and intelligent, and had used all its\nabundant vitality to alter the conditions under which it lived. And now\ncame the reaction of the altered conditions. \n\u0060Under the new conditions of perfect comfort and security, that restless\nenergy, that with us is strength, would become weakness. Even in our\nown time certain tendencies and desires, once necessary to survival, are a\nconstant source of failure. Physical courage and the love of battle, for\ninstance, are no great help--may even be hindrances--to a civilised man.\nAnd in a state of physical balance and security, power, intellectual as\nwell as physical, would be out of place. For countless years I judged\nthere had been no danger of war or solitary violence, no danger from\nwild beasts, no wasting disease to require strength of constitution, no\nneed of toil. For such a life, what we should call the weak are as well\nequipped as the strong, are indeed no longer weak. Better equipped\nindeed they are, for the strong would be fretted by an energy for which\nthere was no outlet. No doubt the exquisite beauty of the buildings I saw\nwas the outcome of the last surgings of the now purposeless energy of\nmankind before it settled down into perfect harmony with the conditions\nunder which it lived--the flourish of that triumph which began the last\ngreat peace. This has ever been the fate of energy in security; it takes to\nart and to eroticism, and then come languor and decay. \n\u0060Even this artistic impetus would at last die away--had almost died in the\nTime I saw. To adorn themselves with flowers, to dance, to sing in the\nsunlight; so much was left of the artistic spirit, and no more. Even that\nwould fade in the end into a contented inactivity. We are kept keen on\nthe grindstone of pain and necessity, and, it seemed to me, that here was\nthat hateful grindstone broken at last! "},{"pageNumber":39,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 38 -\n\u0060As I stood there in the gathering dark I thought that in this simple\nexplanation I had mastered the problem of the world--mastered the whole\nsecret of these delicious people. Possibly the checks they had devised for\nthe increase of population had succeeded too well, and their numbers had\nrather diminished than kept stationary. That would account for the\nabandoned ruins. Very simple was my explanation, and plausible\nenough--as most wrong theories are!"},{"pageNumber":40,"text":"- 39 -\nThe Time Machine\n5\n- 39 -\n\u0060As I stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man, the full\nmoon, yellow and gibbous, came up out of an overflow of silver light in\nthe north-east. The bright little figures ceased to move about below, a\nnoiseless owl flitted by, and I shivered with the chill of the night. I\ndetermined to descend and find where I could sleep. \n\u0060I looked for the building I knew. Then my eye travelled along to the\nfigure of the White Sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze, growing distinct\nas the light of the rising moon grew brighter. I could see the silver birch\nagainst it. There was the tangle of rhododendron bushes, black in the pale\nlight, and there was the little lawn. I looked at the lawn again. A queer\ndoubt chilled my complacency. \u0022No,\u0022 said I stoutly to myself, \u0022that was\nnot the lawn.\u0022 \n\u0060But it was the lawn. For the white leprous face of the sphinx was\ntowards it. Can you imagine what I felt as this conviction came home to\nme? But you cannot. The Time Machine was gone! \n\u0060At once, like a lash across the face, came the possibility of losing my\nown age, of being left helpless in this strange new world. The bare\nthought of it was an actual physical sensation. I could feel it grip me at"},{"pageNumber":41,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 40 -\nthe throat and stop my breathing. In another moment I was in a passion\nof fear and running with great leaping strides down the slope. Once I fell\nheadlong and cut my face; I lost no time in stanching the blood, but\njumped up and ran on, with a warm trickle down my cheek and chin. All\nthe time I ran I was saying to myself: \u0022They have moved it a little,\npushed it under the bushes out of the way.\u0022 Nevertheless, I ran with all\nmy might. All the time, with the certainty that sometimes comes with\nexcessive dread, I knew that such assurance was folly, knew instinctively\nthat the machine was removed out of my reach. My breath came with\npain. I suppose I covered the whole distance from the hill crest to the\nlittle lawn, two miles perhaps, in ten minutes. And I am not a young man.\nI cursed aloud, as I ran, at my confident folly in leaving the machine,\nwasting good breath thereby. I cried aloud, and none answered. Not a\ncreature seemed to be stirring in that moonlit world. \n\u0060When I reached the lawn my worst fears were realized. Not a trace of\nthe thing was to be seen. I felt faint and cold when I faced the empty\nspace among the black tangle of bushes. I ran round it furiously, as if the\nthing might be hidden in a corner, and then stopped abruptly, with my\nhands clutching my hair. Above me towered the sphinx, upon the bronze\npedestal, white, shining, leprous, in the light of the rising moon. It\nseemed to smile in mockery of my dismay. \n\u0060I might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had put the\nmechanism in some shelter for me, had I not felt assured of their physical\nand intellectual inadequacy. That is what dismayed me: the sense of\nsome hitherto unsuspected power, through whose intervention my\ninvention had vanished. Yet, for one thing I felt assured: unless some\nother age had produced its exact duplicate, the machine could not have\nmoved in time. The attachment of the levers--I will show you the method\nlater--prevented any one from tampering with it in that way when they\nwere removed. It had moved, and was hid, only in space. But then, where"},{"pageNumber":42,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 41 -\ncould it be? \n\u0060I think I must have had a kind of frenzy. I remember running violently\nin and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx, and startling\nsome white animal that, in the dim light, I took for a small deer. I\nremember, too, late that night, beating the bushes with my clenched fists\nuntil my knuckles were gashed and bleeding from the broken twigs.\nThen, sobbing and raving in my anguish of mind, I went down to the\ngreat building of stone. The big hall was dark, silent, and deserted. I\nslipped on the uneven floor, and fell over one of the malachite tables,\nalmost breaking my shin. I lit a match and went on past the dusty\ncurtains, of which I have told you. \n\u0060There I found a second great hall covered with cushions, upon which,\nperhaps, a score or so of the little people were sleeping. I have no doubt\nthey found my second appearance strange enough, coming suddenly out\nof the quiet darkness with inarticulate noises and the splutter and flare of\na match. For they had forgotten about matches. \u0022Where is my Time\nMachine?\u0022 I began, bawling like an angry child, laying hands upon them\nand shaking them up together. It must have been very queer to them.\nSome laughed, most of them looked sorely frightened. When I saw them\nstanding round me, it came into my head that I was doing as foolish a\nthing as it was possible for me to do under the circumstances, in trying to\nrevive the sensation of fear. For, reasoning from their daylight behaviour,\nI thought that fear must be forgotten. \n\u0060Abruptly, I dashed down the match, and, knocking one of the people\nover in my course, went blundering across the big dining-hall again, out\nunder the moonlight. I heard cries of terror and their little feet running\nand stumbling this way and that. I do not remember all I did as the moon\ncrept up the sky. I suppose it was the unexpected nature of my loss that\nmaddened me. I felt hopelessly cut off from my own kind--a strange"},{"pageNumber":43,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 42 -\nanimal in an unknown world. I must have raved to and fro, screaming\nand crying upon God and Fate. I have a memory of horrible fatigue, as\nthe long night of despair wore away; of looking in this impossible place\nand that; of groping among moonlit ruins and touching strange creatures\nin the black shadows; at last, of lying on the ground near the sphinx and\nweeping with absolute wretchedness. I had nothing left but misery. Then\nI slept, and when I woke again it was full day, and a couple of sparrows\nwere hopping round me on the turf within reach of my arm. \n\u0060I sat up in the freshness of the morning, trying to remember how I had\ngot there, and why I had such a profound sense of desertion and despair.\nThen things came clear in my mind. With the plain, reasonable daylight,\nI could look my circumstances fairly in the face. I saw the wild folly of\nmy frenzy overnight, and I could reason with myself. \u0022Suppose the\nworst?\u0022 I said. \u0022Suppose the machine altogether lost--perhaps destroyed?\nIt behoves me to be calm and patient, to learn the way of the people, to\nget a clear idea of the method of my loss, and the means of getting\nmaterials and tools; so that in the end, perhaps, I may make another.\u0022\nThat would be my only hope, perhaps, but better than despair. And, after\nall, it was a beautiful and curious world. \n\u0060But probably the machine had only been taken away. Still, I must be\ncalm and patient, find its hiding-place, and recover it by force or\ncunning. And with that I scrambled to my feet and looked about me,\nwondering where I could bathe. I felt weary, stiff, and travel-soiled. The\nfreshness of the morning made me desire an equal freshness. I had\nexhausted my emotion. Indeed, as I went about my business, I found\nmyself wondering at my intense excitement overnight. I made a careful\nexamination of the ground about the little lawn. I wasted some time in\nfutile questionings, conveyed, as well as I was able, to such of the little\npeople as came by. They all failed to understand my gestures; some were\nsimply stolid, some thought it was a jest and laughed at me. I had the"},{"pageNumber":44,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 43 -\nhardest task in the world to keep my hands off their pretty laughing\nfaces. It was a foolish impulse, but the devil begotten of fear and blind\nanger was ill curbed and still eager to take advantage of my perplexity.\nThe turf gave better counsel. I found a groove ripped in it, about midway\nbetween the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of my feet where, on\narrival, I had struggled with the overturned machine. There were other\nsigns of removal about, with queer narrow footprints like those I could\nimagine made by a sloth. This directed my closer attention to the\npedestal. It was, as I think I have said, of bronze. It was not a mere block,\nbut highly decorated with deep framed panels on either side. I went and\nrapped at these. The pedestal was hollow. Examining the panels with\ncare I found them discontinuous with the frames. There were no handles\nor keyholes, but possibly the panels, if they were doors, as I supposed,\nopened from within. One thing was clear enough to my mind. It took no\nvery great mental effort to infer that my Time Machine was inside that\npedestal. But how it got there was a different problem. \n\u0060I saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the bushes\nand under some blossom-covered apple-trees towards me. I turned\nsmiling to them and beckoned them to me. They came, and then,\npointing to the bronze pedestal, I tried to intimate my wish to open it. But\nat my first gesture towards this they behaved very oddly. I don\u0027t know\nhow to convey their expression to you. Suppose you were to use a\ngrossly improper gesture to a delicate-minded woman--it is how she\nwould look. They went off as if they had received the last possible insult.\nI tried a sweet-looking little chap in white next, with exactly the same\nresult. Somehow, his manner made me feel ashamed of myself. But, as\nyou know, I wanted the Time Machine, and I tried him once more. As he\nturned off, like the others, my temper got the better of me. In three\nstrides I was after him, had him by the loose part of his robe round the\nneck, and began dragging him towards the sphinx. Then I saw the horror\nand repugnance of his face, and all of a sudden I let him go. "},{"pageNumber":45,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 44 -\n\u0060But I was not beaten yet. I banged with my fist at the bronze panels. I\nthought I heard something stir inside--to be explicit, I thought I heard a\nsound like a chuckle--but I must have been mistaken. Then I got a big\npebble from the river, and came and hammered till I had flattened a coil\nin the decorations, and the verdigris came off in powdery flakes. The\ndelicate little people must have heard me hammering in gusty outbreaks\na mile away on either hand, but nothing came of it. I saw a crowd of\nthem upon the slopes, looking furtively at me. At last, hot and tired, I sat\ndown to watch the place. But I was too restless to watch long; I am too\nOccidental for a long vigil. I could work at a problem for years, but to\nwait inactive for twenty-four hours--that is another matter. \n\u0060I got up after a time, and began walking aimlessly through the bushes\ntowards the hill again. \u0022Patience,\u0022 said I to myself. \u0022If you want your\nmachine again you must leave that sphinx alone. If they mean to take\nyour machine away, it\u0027s little good your wrecking their bronze panels,\nand if they don\u0027t, you will get it back as soon as you can ask for it. To sit\namong all those unknown things before a puzzle like that is hopeless.\nThat way lies monomania. Face this world. Learn its ways, watch it, be\ncareful of too hasty guesses at its meaning. In the end you will find clues\nto it all.\u0022 Then suddenly the humour of the situation came into my mind:\nthe thought of the years I had spent in study and toil to get into the future\nage, and now my passion of anxiety to get out of it. I had made myself\nthe most complicated and the most hopeless trap that ever a man devised.\nAlthough it was at my own expense, I could not help myself. I laughed\naloud. \n\u0060Going through the big palace, it seemed to me that the little people\navoided me. It may have been my fancy, or it may have had something to\ndo with my hammering at the gates of bronze. Yet I felt tolerably sure of\nthe avoidance. I was careful, however, to show no concern and to abstain\nfrom any pursuit of them, and in the course of a day or two things got"},{"pageNumber":46,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 45 -\nback to the old footing. I made what progress I could in the language,\nand in addition I pushed my explorations here and there. Either I missed\nsome subtle point, or their language was excessively simple--almost\nexclusively composed of concrete substantives and verbs. There seemed\nto be few, if any, abstract terms, or little use of figurative language. Their\nsentences were usually simple and of two words, and I failed to convey\nor understand any but the simplest propositions. I determined to put the\nthought of my Time Machine and the mystery of the bronze doors under\nthe sphinx as much as possible in a corner of memory, until my growing\nknowledge would lead me back to them in a natural way. Yet a certain\nfeeling, you may understand, tethered me in a circle of a few miles round\nthe point of my arrival. \n\u0060So far as I could see, all the world displayed the same exuberant\nrichness as the Thames valley. From every hill I climbed I saw the same\nabundance of splendid buildings, endlessly varied in material and style,\nthe same clustering thickets of evergreens, the same blossom-laden trees\nand tree-ferns. Here and there water shone like silver, and beyond, the\nland rose into blue undulating hills, and so faded into the serenity of the\nsky. A peculiar feature, which presently attracted my attention, was the\npresence of certain circular wells, several, as it seemed to me, of a very\ngreat depth. One lay by the path up the hill, which I had followed during\nmy first walk. Like the others, it was rimmed with bronze, curiously\nwrought, and protected by a little cupola from the rain. Sitting by the side\nof these wells, and peering down into the shafted darkness, I could see no\ngleam of water, nor could I start any reflection with a lighted match. But\nin all of them I heard a certain sound: a thud-thud-thud, like the beating\nof some big engine; and I discovered, from the flaring of my matches,\nthat a steady current of air set down the shafts. Further, I threw a scrap of\npaper into the throat of one, and, instead of fluttering slowly down, it was\nat once sucked swiftly out of sight. "},{"pageNumber":47,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 46 -\n\u0060After a time, too, I came to connect these wells with tall towers standing\nhere and there upon the slopes; for above them there was often just such\na flicker in the air as one sees on a hot day above a sun-scorched beach.\nPutting things together, I reached a strong suggestion of an extensive\nsystem of subterranean ventilation, whose true import it was difficult to\nimagine. I was at first inclined to associate it with the sanitary apparatus\nof these people. It was an obvious conclusion, but it was absolutely\nwrong. \n\u0060And here I must admit that I learned very little of drains and bells and\nmodes of conveyance, and the like conveniences, during my time in this\nreal future. In some of these visions of Utopias and coming times which I\nhave read, there is a vast amount of detail about building, and social\narrangements, and so forth. But while such details are easy enough to\nobtain when the whole world is contained in one\u0027s imagination, they are\naltogether inaccessible to a real traveller amid such realities as I found\nhere. Conceive the tale of London which a negro, fresh from Central\nAfrica, would take back to his tribe! What would he know of railway\ncompanies, of social movements, of telephone and telegraph wires, of the\nParcels Delivery Company, and postal orders and the like? Yet we, at\nleast, should be willing enough to explain these things to him! And even\nof what he knew, how much could he make his untravelled friend either\napprehend or believe? Then, think how narrow the gap between a negro\nand a white man of our own times, and how wide the interval between\nmyself and these of the Golden Age! I was sensible of much which was\nunseen, and which contributed to my comfort; but save for a general\nimpression of automatic organisation, I fear I can convey very little of\nthe difference to your mind. \n\u0060In the matter of sepulture, for instance, I could see no signs of\ncrematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs. But it occurred to me that,\npossibly, there might be cemeteries (or crematoria) somewhere beyond"},{"pageNumber":48,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 47 -\nthe range of my explorings. This, again, was a question I deliberately put\nto myself, and my curiosity was at first entirely defeated upon the point.\nThe thing puzzled me, and I was led to make a further remark, which\npuzzled me still more: that aged and infirm among this people there were\nnone. \n\u0060I must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an\nautomatic civilisation and a decadent humanity did not long endure. Yet I\ncould think of no other. Let me put my difficulties. The several big\npalaces I had explored were mere living places, great dining-halls and\nsleeping apartments. I could find no machinery, no appliances of any\nkind. Yet these people were clothed in pleasant fabrics that must at times\nneed renewal, and their sandals, though undecorated, were fairly\ncomplex specimens of metal-work. Somehow such things must be made.\nAnd the little people displayed no vestige of a creative tendency. There\nwere no shops, no workshops, no sign of importations among them. They\nspent all their time in playing gently, in bathing in the river, in making\nlove in a half-playful fashion, in eating fruit and sleeping. I could not see\nhow things were kept going. \n\u0060Then, again, about the Time Machine: something, I knew not what, had\ntaken it into the hollow pedestal of the White Sphinx. Why? For the life\nof me I could not imagine. Those waterless wells, too, those flickering\npillars. I felt I lacked a clue. I felt--how shall I put it? Suppose you found\nan inscription, with sentences here and there in excellent plain English,\nand interpolated therewith, others made up of words, of letters even,\nabsolutely unknown to you? Well, on the third day of my visit, that was\nhow the world of Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and\nOne presented itself to me! \n\u0060That day, too, I made a friend--of a sort. It happened that, as I was\nwatching some of the little people bathing in a shallow, one of them was"},{"pageNumber":49,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 48 -\nseized with cramp and began drifting downstream. The main current ran\nrather swiftly, but not too strongly for even a moderate swimmer. It will\ngive you an idea, therefore, of the strange deficiency in these creatures,\nwhen I tell you that none made the slightest attempt to rescue the weakly\ncrying little thing which was drowning before their eyes. When I realized\nthis, I hurriedly slipped off my clothes, and, wading in at a point lower\ndown, I caught the poor mite and drew her safe to land. A little rubbing\nof the limbs soon brought her round, and I had the satisfaction of seeing\nshe was all right before I left her. I had got to such a low estimate of her\nkind that I did not expect any gratitude from her. In that, however, I was\nwrong. \n\u0060This happened in the morning. In the afternoon I met my little woman,\nas I believe it was, as I was returning towards my centre from an\nexploration, and she received me with cries of delight and presented me\nwith a big garland of flowers--evidently made for me and me alone. The\nthing took my imagination. Very possibly I had been feeling desolate. At\nany rate I did my best to display my appreciation of the gift. We were\nsoon seated together in a little stone arbour, engaged in conversation,\nchiefly of smiles. The creature\u0027s friendliness affected me exactly as a\nchild\u0027s might have done. We passed each other flowers, and she kissed\nmy hands. I did the same to hers. Then I tried talk, and found that her\nname was Weena, which, though I don\u0027t know what it meant, somehow\nseemed appropriate enough. That was the beginning of a queer friendship\nwhich lasted a week, and ended--as I will tell you! \n\u0060She was exactly like a child. She wanted to be with me always. She tried\nto follow me everywhere, and on my next journey out and about it went\nto my heart to tire her down, and leave her at last, exhausted and calling\nafter me rather plaintively. But the problems of the world had to be\nmastered. I had not, I said to myself, come into the future to carry on a\nminiature flirtation. Yet her distress when I left her was very great, her"},{"pageNumber":50,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 49 -\nexpostulations at the parting were sometimes frantic, and I think,\naltogether, I had as much trouble as comfort from her devotion.\nNevertheless she was, somehow, a very great comfort. I thought it was\nmere childish affection that made her cling to me. Until it was too late, I\ndid not clearly know what I had inflicted upon her when I left her. Nor\nuntil it was too late did I clearly understand what she was to me. For, by\nmerely seeming fond of me, and showing in her weak, futile way that she\ncared for me, the little doll of a creature presently gave my return to the\nneighbourhood of the White Sphinx almost the feeling of coming home;\nand I would watch for her tiny figure of white and gold so soon as I came\nover the hill. \n\u0060It was from her, too, that I learned that fear had not yet left the world.\nShe was fearless enough in the daylight, and she had the oddest\nconfidence in me; for once, in a foolish moment, I made threatening\ngrimaces at her, and she simply laughed at them. But she dreaded the\ndark, dreaded shadows, dreaded black things. Darkness to her was the\none thing dreadful. It was a singularly passionate emotion, and it set me\nthinking and observing. I discovered then, among other things, that these\nlittle people gathered into the great houses after dark, and slept in droves.\nTo enter upon them without a light was to put them into a tumult of\napprehension. I never found one out of doors, or one sleeping alone\nwithin doors, after dark. Yet I was still such a blockhead that I missed the\nlesson of that fear, and in spite of Weena\u0027s distress I insisted upon\nsleeping away from these slumbering multitudes. \n\u0060It troubled her greatly, but in the end her odd affection for me\ntriumphed, and for five of the nights of our acquaintance, including the\nlast night of all, she slept with her head pillowed on my arm. But my\nstory slips away from me as I speak of her. It must have been the night\nbefore her rescue that I was awakened about dawn. I had been restless,\ndreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned, and that sea-anemones"},{"pageNumber":51,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 50 -\nwere feeling over my face with their soft palps. I woke with a start, and\nwith an odd fancy that some greyish animal had just rushed out of the\nchamber. I tried to get to sleep again, but I felt restless and\nuncomfortable. It was that dim grey hour when things are just creeping\nout of darkness, when everything is colourless and clear cut, and yet\nunreal. I got up, and went down into the great hall, and so out upon the\nflagstones in front of the palace. I thought I would make a virtue of\nnecessity, and see the sunrise. \n\u0060The moon was setting, and the dying moonlight and the first pallor of\ndawn were mingled in a ghastly half-light. The bushes were inky black,\nthe ground a sombre grey, the sky colourless and cheerless. And up the\nhill I thought I could see ghosts. Three several times, as I scanned the\nslope, I saw white figures. Twice I fancied I saw a solitary white, ape-\nlike creature running rather quickly up the hill, and once near the ruins I\nsaw a leash of them carrying some dark body. They moved hastily. I did\nnot see what became of them. It seemed that they vanished among the\nbushes. The dawn was still indistinct, you must understand. I was feeling\nthat chill, uncertain, early-morning feeling you may have known. I\ndoubted my eyes. \n\u0060As the eastern sky grew brighter, and the light of the day came on and\nits vivid colouring returned upon the world once more, I scanned the\nview keenly. But I saw no vestige of my white figures. They were mere\ncreatures of the half light. \u0022They must have been ghosts,\u0022 I said; \u0022I\nwonder whence they dated.\u0022 For a queer notion of Grant Allen\u0027s came\ninto my head, and amused me. If each generation die and leave ghosts, he\nargued, the world at last will get overcrowded with them. On that theory\nthey would have grown innumerable some Eight Hundred Thousand\nYears hence, and it was no great wonder to see four at once. But the jest\nwas unsatisfying, and I was thinking of these figures all the morning,\nuntil Weena\u0027s rescue drove them out of my head. I associated them in"},{"pageNumber":52,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 51 -\nsome indefinite way with the white animal I had startled in my first\npassionate search for the Time Machine. But Weena was a pleasant\nsubstitute. Yet all the same, they were soon destined to take far deadlier\npossession of my mind. \n\u0060I think I have said how much hotter than our own was the weather of\nthis Golden Age. I cannot account for it. It may be that the sun was\nhotter, or the earth nearer the sun. It is usual to assume that the sun will\ngo on cooling steadily in the future. But people, unfamiliar with such\nspeculations as those of the younger Darwin, forget that the planets must\nultimately fall back one by one into the parent body. As these\ncatastrophes occur, the sun will blaze with renewed energy; and it may\nbe that some inner planet had suffered this fate. Whatever the reason, the\nfact remains that the sun was very much hotter than we know it. \n\u0060Well, one very hot morning--my fourth, I think--as I was seeking shelter\nfrom the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great house where I\nslept and fed, there happened this strange thing: Clambering among these\nheaps of masonry, I found a narrow gallery, whose end and side windows\nwere blocked by fallen masses of stone. By contrast with the brilliancy\noutside, it seemed at first impenetrably dark to me. I entered it groping,\nfor the change from light to blackness made spots of colour swim before\nme. Suddenly I halted spellbound. A pair of eyes, luminous by reflection\nagainst the daylight without, was watching me out of the darkness. \n\u0060The old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me. I clenched my\nhands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs. I was afraid to\nturn. Then the thought of the absolute security in which humanity\nappeared to be living came to my mind. And then I remembered that\nstrange terror of the dark. Overcoming my fear to some extent, I\nadvanced a step and spoke. I will admit that my voice was harsh and ill-\ncontrolled. I put out my hand and touched something soft. At once the"},{"pageNumber":53,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 52 -\neyes darted sideways, and something white ran past me. I turned with my\nheart in my mouth, and saw a queer little ape-like figure, its head held\ndown in a peculiar manner, running across the sunlit space behind me. It\nblundered against a block of granite, staggered aside, and in a moment\nwas hidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of ruined masonry. \n\u0060My impression of it is, of course, imperfect; but I know it was a dull\nwhite, and had strange large greyish-red eyes; also that there was flaxen\nhair on its head and down its back. But, as I say, it went too fast for me\nto see distinctly. I cannot even say whether it ran on all-fours, or only\nwith its forearms held very low. After an instant\u0027s pause I followed it into\nthe second heap of ruins. I could not find it at first; but, after a time in the\nprofound obscurity, I came upon one of those round well-like openings\nof which I have told you, half closed by a fallen pillar. A sudden thought\ncame to me. Could this Thing have vanished down the shaft? I lit a\nmatch, and, looking down, I saw a small, white, moving creature, with\nlarge bright eyes which regarded me steadfastly as it retreated. It made\nme shudder. It was so like a human spider! It was clambering down the\nwall, and now I saw for the first time a number of metal foot and hand\nrests forming a kind of ladder down the shaft. Then the light burned my\nfingers and fell out of my hand, going out as it dropped, and when I had\nlit another the little monster had disappeared. \n\u0060I do not know how long I sat peering down that well. It was not for\nsome time that I could succeed in persuading myself that the thing I had\nseen was human. But, gradually, the truth dawned on me: that Man had\nnot remained one species, but had differentiated into two distinct\nanimals: that my graceful children of the Upperworld were not the sole\ndescendants of our generation, but that this bleached, obscene, nocturnal\nThing, which had flashed before me, was also heir to all the ages. \n\u0060I thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an underground"},{"pageNumber":54,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 53 -\nventilation. I began to suspect their true import. And what, I wondered,\nwas this Lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly balanced\norganization? How was it related to the indolent serenity of the beautiful\nUpper-worlders? And what was hidden down there, at the foot of that\nshaft? I sat upon the edge of the well telling myself that, at any rate, there\nwas nothing to fear, and that there I must descend for the solution of my\ndifficulties. And withal I was absolutely afraid to go! As I hesitated, two\nof the beautiful Upperworld people came running in their amorous sport\nacross the daylight in the shadow. The male pursued the female, flinging\nflowers at her as he ran. \n\u0060They seemed distressed to find me, my arm against the overturned\npillar, peering down the well. Apparently it was considered bad form to\nremark these apertures; for when I pointed to this one, and tried to frame\na question about it in their tongue, they were still more visibly distressed\nand turned away. But they were interested by my matches, and I struck\nsome to amuse them. I tried them again about the well, and again I failed.\nSo presently I left them, meaning to go back to Weena, and see what I\ncould get from her. But my mind was already in revolution; my guesses\nand impressions were slipping and sliding to a new adjustment. I had\nnow a clue to the import of these wells, to the ventilating towers, to the\nmystery of the ghosts; to say nothing of a hint at the meaning of the\nbronze gates and the fate of the Time Machine! And very vaguely there\ncame a suggestion towards the solution of the economic problem that had\npuzzled me. \n\u0060Here was the new view. Plainly, this second species of Man was\nsubterranean. There were three circumstances in particular which made\nme think that its rare emergence above ground was the outcome of a\nlong-continued underground habit. In the first place, there was the\nbleached look common in most animals that live largely in the dark--the\nwhite fish of the Kentucky caves, for instance. Then, those large eyes,"},{"pageNumber":55,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 54 -\nwith that capacity for reflecting light, are common features of nocturnal\nthings--witness the owl and the cat. And last of all, that evident\nconfusion in the sunshine, that hasty yet fumbling awkward flight\ntowards dark shadow, and that peculiar carriage of the head while in the\nlight--all reinforced the theory of an extreme sensitiveness of the retina. \n\u0060Beneath my feet, then, the earth must be tunnelled enormously, and\nthese tunnellings were the habitat of the new race. The presence of\nventilating-shafts and wells along the hill slopes--everywhere, in fact,\nexcept along the river valley--showed how universal were its\nramifications. What so natural, then, as to assume that it was in this\nartificial Underworld that such work as was necessary to the comfort of\nthe daylight race was done? The notion was so plausible that I at once\naccepted it, and went on to assume the how of this splitting of the human\nspecies. I dare say you will anticipate the shape of my theory; though, for\nmyself, I very soon felt that it fell far short of the truth. \n\u0060At first, proceeding from the problems of our own age, it seemed clear\nas daylight to me that the gradual widening of the present merely\ntemporary and social difference between the Capitalist and the Labourer,\nwas the key to the whole position. No doubt it will seem grotesque\nenough to you--and wildly incredible!--and yet even now there are\nexisting circumstances to point that way. There is a tendency to utilize\nunderground space for the less ornamental purposes of civilisation; there\nis the Metropolitan Railway in London, for instance, there are new\nelectric railways, there are subways, there are underground workrooms\nand restaurants, and they increase and multiply. Evidently, I thought, this\ntendency had increased till Industry had gradually lost its birthright in the\nsky. I mean that it had gone deeper and deeper into larger and ever larger\nunderground factories, spending a still-increasing amount of its time\ntherein, till, in the end--! Even now, does not an East-end worker live in\nsuch artificial conditions as practically to be cut off from the natural"},{"pageNumber":56,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 55 -\nsurface of the earth? \n\u0060Again, the exclusive tendency of richer people--due, no doubt, to the\nincreasing refinement of their education, and the widening gulf between\nthem and the rude violence of the poor--is already leading to the closing,\nin their interest, of considerable portions of the surface of the land. About\nLondon, for instance, perhaps half the prettier country is shut in against\nintrusion. And this same widening gulf--which is due to the length and\nexpense of the higher educational process and the increased facilities for\nand temptations towards refined habits on the part of the rich--will make\nthat exchange between class and class, that promotion by intermarriage\nwhich at present retards the splitting of our species along lines of social\nstratification, less and less frequent. So, in the end, above ground you\nmust have the Haves, pursuing pleasure and comfort and beauty, and\nbelow ground the Have-nots, the Workers getting continually adapted to\nthe conditions of their labour. Once they were there, they would no doubt\nhave to pay rent, and not a little of it, for the ventilation of their caverns;\nand if they refused, they would starve or be suffocated for arrears. Such\nof them as were so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would\ndie; and, in the end, the balance being permanent, the survivors would\nbecome as well adapted to the conditions of underground life, and as\nhappy in their way, as the Upperworld people were to theirs. As it\nseemed to me, the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followed\nnaturally enough. \n\u0060The great triumph of Humanity I had dreamed of took a different shape\nin my mind. It had been no such triumph of moral education and general\nco-operation as I had imagined. Instead, I saw a real aristocracy, armed\nwith a perfected science and working to a logical conclusion the\nindustrial system of to-day. Its triumph had not been simply a triumph\nover Nature, but a triumph over Nature and the fellow-man. This, I must\nwarn you, was my theory at the time. I had no convenient cicerone in the"},{"pageNumber":57,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 56 -\npattern of the Utopian books. My explanation may be absolutely wrong. I\nstill think it is the most plausible one. But even on this supposition the\nbalanced civilisation that was at last attained must have long since passed\nits zenith, and was now far fallen into decay. The too-perfect security of\nthe Upper-worlders had led them to a slow movement of degeneration, to\na general dwindling in size, strength, and intelligence. That I could see\nclearly enough already. What had happened to the Undergrounders I did\nnot yet suspect; but from what I had seen of the Morlocks--that, by the\nby, was the name by which these creatures were called--I could imagine\nthat the modification of the human type was even far more profound than\namong the \u0022Eloi,\u0022 the beautiful race that I already knew. \n\u0060Then came troublesome doubts. Why had the Morlocks taken my Time\nMachine? For I felt sure it was they who had taken it. Why, too, if the\nEloi were masters, could they not restore the machine to me? And why\nwere they so terribly afraid of the dark? I proceeded, as I have said, to\nquestion Weena about this Underworld, but here again I was\ndisappointed. At first she would not understand my questions, and\npresently she refused to answer them. She shivered as though the topic\nwas unendurable. And when I pressed her, perhaps a little harshly, she\nburst into tears. They were the only tears, except my own, I ever saw in\nthat Golden Age. When I saw them I ceased abruptly to trouble about the\nMorlocks, and was only concerned in banishing these signs of the human\ninheritance from Weena\u0027s eyes. And very soon she was smiling and\nclapping her hands, while I solemnly burned a match."},{"pageNumber":58,"text":"- 57 -\nThe Time Machine\n6\n- 57 -\n\u0060It may seem odd to you, but it was two days before I could follow up the\nnew-found clue in what was manifestly the proper way. I felt a peculiar\nshrinking from those pallid bodies. They were just the half-bleached\ncolour of the worms and things one sees preserved in spirit in a\nzoological museum. And they were filthily cold to the touch. Probably\nmy shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic influence of the Eloi,\nwhose disgust of the Morlocks I now began to appreciate. \n\u0060The next night I did not sleep well. Probably my health was a little\ndisordered. I was oppressed with perplexity and doubt. Once or twice I\nhad a feeling of intense fear for which I could perceive no definite\nreason. I remember creeping noiselessly into the great hall where the\nlittle people were sleeping in the moonlight--that night Weena was\namong them--and feeling reassured by their presence. It occurred to me\neven then, that in the course of a few days the moon must pass through\nits last quarter, and the nights grow dark, when the appearances of these\nunpleasant creatures from below, these whitened Lemurs, this new\nvermin that had replaced the old, might be more abundant.

Wells\n- 58 -\nI was so horribly alone, and even to clamber down into the darkness of\nthe well appalled me. I don\u0027t know if you will understand my feeling, but\nI never felt quite safe at my back. \n\u0060It was this restlessness, this insecurity, perhaps, that drove me further\nand further afield in my exploring expeditions. Going to the south-\nwestward towards the rising country that is now called Combe Wood, I\nobserved far off, in the direction of nineteenth-century Banstead, a vast\ngreen structure, different in character from any I had hitherto seen. It was\nlarger than the largest of the palaces or ruins I knew, and the facade had\nan Oriental look: the face of it having the lustre, as well as the pale-green\ntint, a kind of bluish-green, of a certain type of Chinese porcelain. This\ndifference in aspect suggested a difference in use, and I was minded to\npush on and explore. But the day was growing late, and I had come upon\nthe sight of the place after a long and tiring circuit; so I resolved to hold\nover the adventure for the following day, and I returned to the welcome\nand the caresses of little Weena. But next morning I perceived clearly\nenough that my curiosity regarding the Palace of Green Porcelain was a\npiece of self-deception, to enable me to shirk, by another day, an\nexperience I dreaded. I resolved I would make the descent without\nfurther waste of time, and started out in the early morning towards a well\nnear the ruins of granite and aluminium. \n\u0060Little Weena ran with me. She danced beside me to the well, but when\nshe saw me lean over the mouth and look downward, she seemed\nstrangely disconcerted. \u0022Good-bye, Little Weena,\u0022 I said, kissing her;\nand then putting her down, I began to feel over the parapet for the\nclimbing hooks. Rather hastily, I may as well confess, for I feared my\ncourage might leak away! At first she watched me in amazement. Then\nshe gave a most piteous cry, and running to me, she began to pull at me\nwith her little hands. I think her opposition nerved me rather to proceed. I\nshook her off, perhaps a little roughly, and in another moment I was in"},{"pageNumber":60,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 59 -\nthe throat of the well. I saw her agonized face over the parapet, and\nsmiled to reassure her. Then I had to look down at the unstable hooks to\nwhich I clung. \n\u0060I had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards. The\ndescent was effected by means of metallic bars projecting from the sides\nof the well, and these being adapted to the needs of a creature much\nsmaller and lighter than myself, I was speedily cramped and fatigued by\nthe descent. And not simply fatigued! One of the bars bent suddenly\nunder my weight, and almost swung me off into the blackness beneath.\nFor a moment I hung by one hand, and after that experience I did not\ndare to rest again. Though my arms and back were presently acutely\npainful, I went on clambering down the sheer descent with as quick a\nmotion as possible. Glancing upward, I saw the aperture, a small blue\ndisk, in which a star was visible, while little Weena\u0027s head showed as a\nround black projection. The thudding sound of a machine below grew\nlouder and more oppressive. Everything save that little disk above was\nprofoundly dark, and when I looked up again Weena had disappeared. \n\u0060I was in an agony of discomfort. I had some thought of trying to go up\nthe shaft again, and leave the Underworld alone. But even while I turned\nthis over in my mind I continued to descend. At last, with intense relief, I\nsaw dimly coming up, a foot to the right of me, a slender loophole in the\nwall. Swinging myself in, I found it was the aperture of a narrow\nhorizontal tunnel in which I could lie down and rest. It was not too soon.\nMy arms ached, my back was cramped, and I was trembling with the\nprolonged terror of a fall. Besides this, the unbroken darkness had had a\ndistressing effect upon my eyes. The air was full of the throb and hum of\nmachinery pumping air down the shaft. \n\u0060I do not know how long I lay. I was roused by a soft hand touching my\nface. Starting up in the darkness I snatched at my matches and, hastily"},{"pageNumber":61,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 60 -\nstriking one, I saw three stooping white creatures similar to the one I had\nseen above ground in the ruin, hastily retreating before the light. Living,\nas they did, in what appeared to me impenetrable darkness, their eyes\nwere abnormally large and sensitive, just as are the pupils of the abysmal\nfishes, and they reflected the light in the same way. I have no doubt they\ncould see me in that rayless obscurity, and they did not seem to have any\nfear of me apart from the light. But, so soon as I struck a match in order\nto see them, they fled incontinently, vanishing into dark gutters and\ntunnels, from which their eyes glared at me in the strangest fashion. \n\u0060I tried to call to them, but the language they had was apparently\ndifferent from that of the Upperworld people; so that I was needs left to\nmy own unaided efforts, and the thought of flight before exploration was\neven then in my mind. But I said to myself, \u0022You are in for it now,\u0022 and,\nfeeling my way along the tunnel, I found the noise of machinery grow\nlouder. Presently the walls fell away from me, and I came to a large open\nspace, and striking another match, saw that I had entered a vast arched\ncavern, which stretched into utter darkness beyond the range of my light.\nThe view I had of it was as much as one could see in the burning of a\nmatch. \n\u0060Necessarily my memory is vague. Great shapes like big machines rose\nout of the dimness, and cast grotesque black shadows, in which dim\nspectral Morlocks sheltered from the glare. The place, by the by, was\nvery stuffy and oppressive, and the faint halitus of freshly shed blood\nwas in the air. Some way down the central vista was a little table of white\nmetal, laid with what seemed a meal. The Morlocks at any rate were\ncarnivorous! Even at the time, I remember wondering what large animal\ncould have survived to furnish the red joint I saw. It was all very\nindistinct: the heavy smell, the big unmeaning shapes, the obscene\nfigures lurking in the shadows, and only waiting for the darkness to come\nat me again! Then the match burned down, and stung my fingers, and"},{"pageNumber":62,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 61 -\nfell, a wriggling red spot in the blackness. \n\u0060I have thought since how particularly ill-equipped I was for such an\nexperience. When I had started with the Time Machine, I had started\nwith the absurd assumption that the men of the Future would certainly be\ninfinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances. I had come without\narms, without medicine, without anything to smoke--at times I missed\ntobacco frightfully!--even without enough matches. If only I had thought\nof a Kodak! I could have flashed that glimpse of the Underworld in a\nsecond, and examined it at leisure. But, as it was, I stood there with only\nthe weapons and the powers that Nature had endowed me with--hands,\nfeet, and teeth; these, and four safety-matches that still remained to me. \n\u0060I was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the dark,\nand it was only with my last glimpse of light I discovered that my store\nof matches had run low. It had never occurred to me until that moment\nthat there was any need to economize them, and I had wasted almost half\nthe box in astonishing the Upper-worlders, to whom fire was a novelty.\nNow, as I say, I had four left, and while I stood in the dark, a hand\ntouched mine, lank fingers came feeling over my face, and I was sensible\nof a peculiar unpleasant odour. I fancied I heard the breathing of a crowd\nof those dreadful little beings about me. I felt the box of matches in my\nhand being gently disengaged, and other hands behind me plucking at my\nclothing. The sense of these unseen creatures examining me was\nindescribably unpleasant. The sudden realisation of my ignorance of their\nways of thinking and doing came home to me very vividly in the\ndarkness. I shouted at them as loudly as I could. They started away, and\nthen I could feel them approaching me again. They clutched at me more\nboldly, whispering odd sounds to each other. I shivered violently, and\nshouted again--rather discordantly. This time they were not so seriously\nalarmed, and they made a queer laughing noise as they came back at me.\nI will confess I was horribly frightened. I determined to strike another"},{"pageNumber":63,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 62 -\nmatch and escape under the protection of its glare. I did so, and eking out\nthe flicker with a scrap of paper from my pocket, I made good my retreat\nto the narrow tunnel. But I had scarce entered this when my light was\nblown out and in the blackness I could hear the Morlocks rustling like\nwind among leaves, and pattering like the rain, as they hurried after me. \n\u0060In a moment I was clutched by several hands, and there was no\nmistaking that they were trying to haul me back. I struck another light,\nand waved it in their dazzled faces. You can scarce imagine how\nnauseatingly inhuman they looked--those pale, chinless faces and great,\nlidless, pinkish-grey eyes!--as they stared in their blindness and\nbewilderment. But I did not stay to look, I promise you: I retreated again,\nand when my second match had ended, I struck my third. It had almost\nburned through when I reached the opening into the shaft. I lay down on\nthe edge, for the throb of the great pump below made me giddy. Then I\nfelt sideways for the projecting hooks, and, as I did so, my feet were\ngrasped from behind, and I was violently tugged backward. I lit my last\nmatch...and it incontinently went out. But I had my hand on the climbing\nbars now, and, kicking violently, I disengaged myself from the clutches\nof the Morlocks and was speedily clambering up the shaft, while they\nstayed peering and blinking up at me: all but one little wretch who\nfollowed me for some way, and well-nigh secured my boot as a trophy. \n\u0060That climb seemed interminable to me. With the last twenty or thirty\nfeet of it a deadly nausea came upon me. I had the greatest difficulty in\nkeeping my hold. The last few yards was a frightful struggle against this\nfaintness. Several times my head swam, and I felt all the sensations of\nfalling. At last, however, I got over the well-mouth somehow, and\nstaggered out of the ruin into the blinding sunlight. I fell upon my face.\nEven the soil smelt sweet and clean. Then I remember Weena kissing my\nhands and ears, and the voices of others among the Eloi.

Hitherto, except\nduring my night\u0027s anguish at the loss of the Time Machine, I had felt a\nsustaining hope of ultimate escape, but that hope was staggered by these\nnew discoveries. Hitherto I had merely thought myself impeded by the\nchildish simplicity of the little people, and by some unknown forces\nwhich I had only to understand to overcome; but there was an altogether\nnew element in the sickening quality of the Morlocks--a something\ninhuman and malign. Instinctively I loathed them. Before, I had felt as a\nman might feel who had fallen into a pit: my concern was with the pit\nand how to get out of it. Now I felt like a beast in a trap, whose enemy\nwould come upon him soon. \n\u0060The enemy I dreaded may surprise you. It was the darkness of the new\nmoon. Weena had put this into my head by some at first\nincomprehensible remarks about the Dark Nights. It was not now such a\nvery difficult problem to guess what the coming Dark Nights might\nmean. The moon was on the wane: each night there was a longer interval\nof darkness. And I now understood to some slight degree at least the\nreason of the fear of the little Upperworld people for the dark. I\nwondered vaguely what foul villainy it might be that the Morlocks did\nunder the new moon. I felt pretty sure now that my second hypothesis\nwas all wrong. The Upperworld people might once have been the"},{"pageNumber":65,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 64 -\nfavoured aristocracy, and the Morlocks their mechanical servants: but\nthat had long since passed away. The two species that had resulted from\nthe evolution of man were sliding down towards, or had already arrived\nat, an altogether new relationship. The Eloi, like the Carlovingian kings,\nhad decayed to a mere beautiful futility. They still possessed the earth on\nsufferance: since the Morlocks, subterranean for innumerable\ngenerations, had come at last to find the daylit surface intolerable. And\nthe Morlocks made their garments, I inferred, and maintained them in\ntheir habitual needs, perhaps through the survival of an old habit of\nservice. They did it as a standing horse paws with his foot, or as a man\nenjoys killing animals in sport: because ancient and departed necessities\nhad impressed it on the organism. But, clearly, the old order was already\nin part reversed. The Nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on\napace. Ages ago, thousands of generations ago, man had thrust his\nbrother man out of the ease and the sunshine. And now that brother was\ncoming back -- changed! Already the Eloi had begun to learn one old\nlesson anew. They were becoming reacquainted with Fear. And suddenly\nthere came into my head the memory of the meat I had seen in the\nUnderworld. It seemed odd how it floated into my mind: not stirred up as\nit were by the current of my meditations, but coming in almost like a\nquestion from outside. I tried to recall the form of it. I had a vague sense\nof something familiar, but I could not tell what it was at the time. \n\u0060Still, however helpless the little people in the presence of their\nmysterious Fear, I was differently constituted. I came out of this age of\nours, this ripe prime of the human race, when Fear does not paralyse and\nmystery has lost its terrors. I at least would defend myself. Without\nfurther delay I determined to make myself arms and a fastness where I\nmight sleep. With that refuge as a base, I could face this strange world\nwith some of that confidence I had lost in realizing to what creatures\nnight by night I lay exposed. I felt I could never sleep again until my bed\nwas secure from them. I shuddered with horror to think how they must\nalready have examined me. "},{"pageNumber":66,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 65 -\n\u0060I wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the Thames, but\nfound nothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible. All the\nbuildings and trees seemed easily practicable to such dexterous climbers\nas the Morlocks, to judge by their wells, must be. Then the tall pinnacles\nof the Palace of Green Porcelain and the polished gleam of its walls\ncame back to my memory; and in the evening, taking Weena like a child\nupon my shoulder, I went up the hills towards the south-west. The\ndistance, I had reckoned, was seven or eight miles, but it must have been\nnearer eighteen. I had first seen the place on a moist afternoon when\ndistances are deceptively diminished. In addition, the heel of one of my\nshoes was loose, and a nail was working through the sole--they were\ncomfortable old shoes I wore about indoors--so that I was lame. And it\nwas already long past sunset when I came in sight of the palace,\nsilhouetted black against the pale yellow of the sky. \n\u0060Weena had been hugely delighted when I began to carry her, but after a\ntime she desired me to let her down, and ran along by the side of me,\noccasionally darting off on either hand to pick flowers to stick in my\npockets. My pockets had always puzzled Weena, but at the last she had\nconcluded that they were an eccentric kind of vase for floral decoration.\nAt least she utilized them for that purpose.

But I pointed out the distant pinnacles of the\nPalace of Green Porcelain to her, and contrived to make her understand\nthat we were seeking a refuge there from her Fear. You know that great"},{"pageNumber":67,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 66 -\npause that comes upon things before the dusk? Even the breeze stops in\nthe trees. To me there is always an air of expectation about that evening\nstillness. The sky was clear, remote, and empty save for a few horizontal\nbars far down in the sunset. Well, that night the expectation took the\ncolour of my fears. In that darkling calm my senses seemed\npreternaturally sharpened. I fancied I could even feel the hollowness of\nthe ground beneath my feet: could, indeed, almost see through it the\nMorlocks on their ant-hill going hither and thither and waiting for the\ndark. In my excitement I fancied that they would receive my invasion of\ntheir burrows as a declaration of war. And why had they taken my Time\nMachine? \n\u0060So we went on in the quiet, and the twilight deepened into night. The\nclear blue of the distance faded, and one star after another came out. The\nground grew dim and the trees black. Weena\u0027s fears and her fatigue grew\nupon her. I took her in my arms and talked to her and caressed her. Then,\nas the darkness grew deeper, she put her arms round my neck, and,\nclosing her eyes, tightly pressed her face against my shoulder. So we\nwent down a long slope into a valley, and there in the dimness I almost\nwalked into a little river. This I waded, and went up the opposite side of\nthe valley, past a number of sleeping houses, and by a statue--a Faun, or\nsome such figure, minus the head. Here too were acacias. So far I had\nseen nothing of the Morlocks, but it was yet early in the night, and the\ndarker hours before the old moon rose were still to come. \n\u0060From the brow of the next hill I saw a thick wood spreading wide and\nblack before me. I hesitated at this. I could see no end to it, either to the\nright or the left. Feeling tired--my feet, in particular, were very sore--I\ncarefully lowered Weena from my shoulder as I halted, and sat down\nupon the turf. I could no longer see the Palace of Green Porcelain, and I\nwas in doubt of my direction. I looked into the thickness of the wood and\nthought of what it might hide. Under that dense tangle of branches one"},{"pageNumber":68,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 67 -\nwould be out of sight of the stars. Even were there no other lurking\ndanger--a danger I did not care to let my imagination loose upon--there\nwould still be all the roots to stumble over and the tree-boles to strike\nagainst. \n\u0060I was very tired, too, after the excitements of the day; so I decided that I\nwould not face it, but would pass the night upon the open hill. \n\u0060Weena, I was glad to find, was fast asleep. I carefully wrapped her in\nmy jacket, and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise. The hillside\nwas quiet and deserted, but from the black of the wood there came now\nand then a stir of living things. Above me shone the stars, for the night\nwas very clear. I felt a certain sense of friendly comfort in their\ntwinkling. All the old constellations had gone from the sky, however:\nthat slow movement which is imperceptible in a hundred human\nlifetimes, had long since rearranged them in unfamiliar groupings. But\nthe Milky Way, it seemed to me, was still the same tattered streamer of\nstar-dust as of yore. Southward (as I judged it) was a very bright red star\nthat was new to me; it was even more splendid than our own green\nSirius. And amid all these scintillating points of light one bright planet\nshone kindly and steadily like the face of an old friend. \n\u0060Looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all the\ngravities of terrestrial life. I thought of their unfathomable distance, and\nthe slow inevitable drift of their movements out of the unknown past into\nthe unknown future. I thought of the great precessional cycle that the\npole of the earth describes. Only forty times had that silent revolution\noccurred during all the years that I had traversed. And during these few\nrevolutions all the activity, all the traditions, the complex organizations,\nthe nations, languages, literatures, aspirations, even the mere memory of\nMan as I knew him, had been swept out of existence. Instead were these\nfrail creatures who had forgotten their high ancestry, and the white"},{"pageNumber":69,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 68 -\nThings of which I went in terror. Then I thought of the Great Fear that\nwas between the two species, and for the first time, with a sudden shiver,\ncame the clear knowledge of what the meat I had seen might be. Yet it\nwas too horrible! I looked at little Weena sleeping beside me, her face\nwhite and starlike under the stars, and forthwith dismissed the thought. \n\u0060Through that long night I held my mind off the Morlocks as well as I\ncould, and whiled away the time by trying to fancy I could find signs of\nthe old constellations in the new confusion. The sky kept very clear,\nexcept for a hazy cloud or so. No doubt I dozed at times. Then, as my\nvigil wore on, came a faintness in the eastward sky, like the reflection of\nsome colourless fire, and the old moon rose, thin and peaked and white.\nAnd close behind, and overtaking it, and overflowing it, the dawn came,\npale at first, and then growing pink and warm. No Morlocks had\napproached us. Indeed, I had seen none upon the hill that night. And in\nthe confidence of renewed day it almost seemed to me that my fear had\nbeen unreasonable. I stood up and found my foot with the loose heel\nswollen at the ankle and painful under the heel; so I sat down again, took\noff my shoes, and flung them away. \n\u0060I awakened Weena, and we went down into the wood, now green and\npleasant instead of black and forbidding. We found some fruit wherewith\nto break our fast. We soon met others of the dainty ones, laughing and\ndancing in the sunlight as though there was no such thing in nature as the\nnight. And then I thought once more of the meat that I had seen. I felt\nassured now of what it was, and from the bottom of my heart I pitied this\nlast feeble rill from the great flood of humanity. Clearly, at some time in\nthe Long-Ago of human decay the Morlocks\u0027 food had run short.\nPossibly they had lived on rats and suchlike vermin. Even now man is far\nless discriminating and exclusive in his food than he was--far less than\nany monkey. His prejudice against human flesh is no deep-seated\ninstinct. And so these inhuman sons of men--! I tried to look at the thing"},{"pageNumber":70,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 69 -\nin a scientific spirit. After all, they were less human and more remote\nthan our cannibal ancestors of three or four thousand years ago. And the\nintelligence that would have made this state of things a torment had\ngone. Why should I trouble myself? These Eloi were mere fatted cattle,\nwhich the ant-like Morlocks preserved and preyed upon--probably saw to\nthe breeding of. And there was Weena dancing at my side! \n\u0060Then I tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming upon\nme, by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of human selfishness. Man\nhad been content to live in ease and delight upon the labours of his\nfellow-man, had taken Necessity as his watchword and excuse, and in the\nfullness of time Necessity had come home to him. I even tried a Carlyle-\nlike scorn of this wretched aristocracy in decay. But this attitude of mind\nwas impossible. However great their intellectual degradation, the Eloi\nhad kept too much of the human form not to claim my sympathy, and to\nmake me perforce a sharer in their degradation and their Fear. \n\u0060I had at that time very vague ideas as to the course I should pursue. My\nfirst was to secure some safe place of refuge, and to make myself such\narms of metal or stone as I could contrive. That necessity was immediate.\nIn the next place, I hoped to procure some means of fire, so that I should\nhave the weapon of a torch at hand, for nothing, I knew, would be more\nefficient against these Morlocks. Then I wanted to arrange some\ncontrivance to break open the doors of bronze under the White Sphinx. I\nhad in mind a battering-ram. I had a persuasion that if I could enter those\ndoors and carry a blaze of light before me I should discover the Time\nMachine and escape. I could not imagine the Morlocks were strong\nenough to move it far away. Weena I had resolved to bring with me to\nour own time. And turning such schemes over in my mind I pursued our\nway towards the building which my fancy had chosen as our dwelling."},{"pageNumber":71,"text":"- 70 -\nThe Time Machine\n8\n- 70 -\n\u0060I found the Palace of Green Porcelain, when we approached it about\nnoon, deserted and falling into ruin. Only ragged vestiges of glass\nremained in its windows, and great sheets of the green facing had fallen\naway from the corroded metallic framework. It lay very high upon a\nturfy down, and looking north-eastward before I entered it, I was\nsurprised to see a large estuary, or even creek, where I judged\nWandsworth and Battersea must once have been. I thought then--though\nI never followed up the thought--of what might have happened, or might\nbe happening, to the living things in the sea. \n\u0060The material of the Palace proved on examination to be indeed\nporcelain, and along the face of it I saw an inscription in some unknown\ncharacter. I thought, rather foolishly, that Weena might help me to\ninterpret this, but I only learned that the bare idea of writing had never\nentered her head. She always seemed to me, I fancy, more human than\nshe was, perhaps because her affection was so human. \n\u0060Within the big valves of the door--which were open and broken--we\nfound, instead of the customary hall, a long gallery lit by many side\nwindows. At the first glance I was reminded of a museum. The tiled floor\nwas thick with dust, and a remarkable array of miscellaneous objects was\nshrouded in the same grey covering. Then I perceived, standing strange"},{"pageNumber":72,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 71 -\nand gaunt in the centre of the hall, what was clearly the lower part of a\nhuge skeleton. I recognized by the oblique feet that it was some extinct\ncreature after the fashion of the Megatherium. The skull and the upper\nbones lay beside it in the thick dust, and in one place, where rain-water\nhad dropped through a leak in the roof, the thing itself had been worn\naway. Further in the gallery was the huge skeleton barrel of a\nBrontosaurus. My museum hypothesis was confirmed. Going towards the\nside I found what appeared to be sloping shelves, and, clearing away the\nthick dust, I found the old familiar glass cases of our own time. But they\nmust have been air-tight to judge from the fair preservation of some of\ntheir contents. \n\u0060Clearly we stood among the ruins of some latter-day South Kensington!\nHere, apparently, was the Palontological Section, and a very splendid\narray of fossils it must have been, though the inevitable process of decay\nthat had been staved off for a time, and had, through the extinction of\nbacteria and fungi, lost ninety-nine hundredths of its force, was,\nnevertheless, with extreme sureness if with extreme slowness at work\nagain upon all its treasures. Here and there I found traces of the little\npeople in the shape of rare fossils broken to pieces or threaded in strings\nupon reeds. And the cases had in some instances been bodily removed--\nby the Morlocks as I judged. The place was very silent. The thick dust\ndeadened our footsteps. Weena, who had been rolling a sea urchin down\nthe sloping glass of a case, presently came, as I stared about me, and very\nquietly took my hand and stood beside me. \n\u0060And at first I was so much surprised by this ancient monument of an\nintellectual age, that I gave no thought to the possibilities it presented.\nEven my preoccupation about the Time Machine receded a little from my\nmind. \n\u0060To judge from the size of the place, this Palace of Green Porcelain had a"},{"pageNumber":73,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 72 -\ngreat deal more in it than a Gallery of Palontology; possibly historical\ngalleries; it might be, even a library! To me, at least in my present\ncircumstances, these would be vastly more interesting than this spectacle\nof old-time geology in decay. Exploring, I found another short gallery\nrunning transversely to the first. This appeared to be devoted to minerals,\nand the sight of a block of sulphur set my mind running on gunpowder.\nBut I could find no saltpetre; indeed, no nitrates of any kind. Doubtless\nthey had deliquesced ages ago. Yet the sulphur hung in my mind, and set\nup a train of thinking. As for the rest of the contents of that gallery,\nthough on the whole they were the best preserved of all I saw, I had little\ninterest. I am no specialist in mineralogy, and I went on down a very\nruinous aisle running parallel to the first hall I had entered. Apparently\nthis section had been devoted to natural history, but everything had long\nsince passed out of recognition. A few shrivelled and blackened vestiges\nof what had once been stuffed animals, desiccated mummies in jars that\nhad once held spirit, a brown dust of departed plants; that was all! I was\nsorry for that, because I should have been glad to trace the patent\nreadjustments by which the conquest of animated nature had been\nattained. Then we came to a gallery of simply colossal proportions, but\nsingularly ill-lit, the floor of it running downward at a slight angle from\nthe end at which I entered. At intervals white globes hung from the\nceiling--many of them cracked and smashed--which suggested that\noriginally the place had been artificially lit. Here I was more in my\nelement, for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of big\nmachines, all greatly corroded and many broken down, but some still\nfairly complete. You know I have a certain weakness for mechanism, and\nI was inclined to linger among these; the more so as for the most part\nthey had the interest of puzzles, and I could make only the vaguest\nguesses at what they were for. I fancied that if I could solve their puzzles\nI should find myself in possession of powers that might be of use against\nthe Morlocks. \n\u0060Suddenly Weena came very close to my side. So suddenly that she"},{"pageNumber":74,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 73 -\nstartled me. Had it not been for her I do not think I should have noticed\nthat the floor of the gallery sloped at all.1 The end I had come in at was\nquite above ground, and was lit by rare slit-like windows. As you went\ndown the length, the ground came up against these windows, until at last\nthere was a pit like the \u0022area\u0022 of a London house before each, and only a\nnarrow line of daylight at the top. I went slowly along, puzzling about\nthe machines, and had been too intent upon them to notice the gradual\ndiminution of the light, until Weena\u0027s increasing apprehensions drew my\nattention. Then I saw that the gallery ran down at last into a thick\ndarkness. I hesitated, and then, as I looked round me, I saw that the dust\nwas less abundant and its surface less even. Further away towards the\ndimness, it appeared to be broken by a number of small narrow\nfootprints. My sense of the immediate presence of the Morlocks revived\nat that. I felt that I was wasting my time in the academic examination of\nmachinery. I called to mind that it was already far advanced in the\nafternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge, and no means of\nmaking a fire. And then down in the remote blackness of the gallery I\nheard a peculiar pattering, and the same odd noises I had heard down the\nwell. \n\u0060I took Weena\u0027s hand. Then, struck with a sudden idea, I left her and\nturned to a machine from which projected a lever not unlike those in a\nsignal-box. Clambering upon the stand, and grasping this lever in my\nhands, I put all my weight upon it sideways. Suddenly Weena, deserted\nin the central aisle, began to whimper. I had judged the strength of the\nlever pretty correctly, for it snapped after a minute\u0027s strain, and I rejoined\nher with a mace in my hand more than sufficient, I judged, for any\nMorlock skull I might encounter. And I longed very much to kill a\nMorlock or so. Very inhuman, you may think, to want to go killing one\u0027s\nown descendants! But it was impossible, somehow, to feel any humanity\nin the things. Only my disinclination to leave Weena, and a persuasion\nthat if I began to slake my thirst for murder my Time Machine might\nsuffer, restrained me from going straight down the gallery and killing the"},{"pageNumber":75,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 74 -\nbrutes I heard. \n\u0060Well, mace in one hand and Weena in the other, I went out of that\ngallery and into another and still larger one, which at the first glance\nreminded me of a military chapel hung with tattered flags. The brown\nand charred rags that hung from the sides of it, I presently recognized as\nthe decaying vestiges of books. They had long since dropped to pieces,\nand every semblance of print had left them. But here and there were\nwarped boards and cracked metallic clasps that told the tale well enough.\nHad I been a literary man I might, perhaps, have moralized upon the\nfutility of all ambition. But as it was, the thing that struck me with\nkeenest force was the enormous waste of labour to which this sombre\nwilderness of rotting paper testified. At the time I will confess that I\nthought chiefly of the Philosophical Transactions and my own seventeen\npapers upon physical optics. \n\u0060Then, going up a broad staircase, we came to what may once have been\na gallery of technical chemistry. And here I had not a little hope of useful\ndiscoveries. Except at one end where the roof had collapsed, this gallery\nwas well preserved. I went eagerly to every unbroken case. And at last,\nin one of the really airtight cases, I found a box of matches. Very eagerly\nI tried them. They were perfectly good. They were not even damp. I\nturned to Weena. \u0022Dance,\u0022 I cried to her in her own tongue. For now I\nhad a weapon indeed against the horrible creatures we feared. And so, in\nthat derelict museum, upon the thick soft carpeting of dust, to Weena\u0027s\nhuge delight, I solemnly performed a kind of composite dance, whistling\nThe Land of the Leal as cheerfully as I could. In part it was a modest\ncancan, in part a step-dance, in part a skirt-dance (so far as my tail-coat\npermitted), and in part original. For I am naturally inventive, as you\nknow. \n\u0060Now, I still think that for this box of matches to have escaped the wear"},{"pageNumber":76,"text":"H. G.

Yet, oddly enough, I found a far unlikelier substance,\nand that was camphor. I found it in a sealed jar, that by chance, I\nsuppose, had been really hermetically sealed. I fancied at first that it was\nparaffin wax, and smashed the glass accordingly. But the odour of\ncamphor was unmistakable. In the universal decay this volatile substance\nhad chanced to survive, perhaps through many thousands of centuries. It\nreminded me of a sepia painting I had once seen done from the ink of a\nfossil Belemnite that must have perished and become fossilized millions\nof years ago. I was about to throw it away, but I remembered that it was\ninflammable and burned with a good bright flame--was, in fact, an\nexcellent candle--and I put it in my pocket. I found no explosives,\nhowever, nor any means of breaking down the bronze doors. As yet my\niron crowbar was the most helpful thing I had chanced upon.\nNevertheless I left that gallery greatly elated. \n\u0060I cannot tell you all the story of that long afternoon. It would require a\ngreat effort of memory to recall my explorations in at all the proper\norder. I remember a long gallery of rusting stands of arms, and how I\nhesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a sword. I could not carry\nboth, however, and my bar of iron promised best against the bronze\ngates. There were numbers of guns, pistols, and rifles. The most were\nmasses of rust, but many were of some new metal, and still fairly sound.\nBut any cartridges or powder there may once have been had rotted into\ndust. One corner I saw was charred and shattered; perhaps, I thought, by\nan explosion among the specimens. In another place was a vast array of\nidols--Polynesian, Mexican, Grecian, Phoenician, every country on earth\nI should think. And here, yielding to an irresistible impulse, I wrote my\nname upon the nose of a steatite monster from South America that\nparticularly took my fancy. \n\u0060As the evening drew on, my interest waned. I went through gallery after"},{"pageNumber":77,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 76 -\ngallery, dusty, silent, often ruinous, the exhibits sometimes mere heaps of\nrust and lignite, sometimes fresher. In one place I suddenly found myself\nnear the model of a tin-mine, and then by the merest accident I\ndiscovered, in an airtight case, two dynamite cartridges! I shouted\n\u0022Eureka!\u0022 and smashed the case with joy. Then came a doubt. I hesitated.\nThen, selecting a little side gallery, I made my essay. I never felt such a\ndisappointment as I did in waiting five, ten, fifteen minutes for an\nexplosion that never came. Of course the things were dummies, as I\nmight have guessed from their presence. I really believe that had they not\nbeen so, I should have rushed off incontinently and blown Sphinx,\nbronze doors, and (as it proved) my chances of finding the Time\nMachine, all together into non-existence. \n\u0060It was after that, I think, that we came to a little open court within the\npalace. It was turfed, and had three fruit-trees. So we rested and\nrefreshed ourselves. Towards sunset I began to consider our position.\nNight was creeping upon us, and my inaccessible hiding-place had still to\nbe found. But that troubled me very little now. I had in my possession a\nthing that was, perhaps, the best of all defences against the Morlocks--I\nhad matches! I had the camphor in my pocket, too, if a blaze were\nneeded. It seemed to me that the best thing we could do would be to pass\nthe night in the open, protected by a fire. In the morning there was the\ngetting of the Time Machine. Towards that, as yet, I had only my iron\nmace. But now, with my growing knowledge, I felt very differently\ntowards those bronze doors. Up to this, I had refrained from forcing\nthem, largely because of the mystery on the other side. They had never\nimpressed me as being very strong, and I hoped to find my bar of iron\nnot altogether inadequate for the work."},{"pageNumber":78,"text":"- 77 -\nThe Time Machine\n9\n- 77 -\n\u0060We emerged from the palace while the sun was still in part above the\nhorizon. I was determined to reach the White Sphinx early the next\nmorning, and ere the dusk I purposed pushing through the woods that\nhad stopped me on the previous journey. My plan was to go as far as\npossible that night, and then, building a fire, to sleep in the protection of\nits glare. Accordingly, as we went along I gathered any sticks or dried\ngrass I saw, and presently had my arms full of such litter. Thus loaded,\nour progress was slower than I had anticipated, and besides Weena was\ntired. And I began to suffer from sleepiness too; so that it was full night\nbefore we reached the wood. Upon the shrubby hill of its edge Weena\nwould have stopped, fearing the darkness before us; but a singular sense\nof impending calamity, that should indeed have served me as a warning,\ndrove me onward. I had been without sleep for a night and two days, and\nI was feverish and irritable. I felt sleep coming upon me, and the\nMorlocks with it. \n\u0060While we hesitated, among the black bushes behind us, and dim against\ntheir blackness, I saw three crouching figures. There was scrub and long\ngrass all about us, and I did not feel safe from their insidious approach.\nThe forest, I calculated, was rather less than a mile across. If we could\nget through it to the bare hill-side, there, as it seemed to me, was an\naltogether safer resting-place; I thought that with my matches and my"},{"pageNumber":79,"text":"The Time Machine H.

Yet it was evident that if I was to flourish matches with my hands\nI should have to abandon my firewood; so, rather reluctantly, I put it\ndown. And then it came into my head that I would amaze our friends\nbehind by lighting it. I was to discover the atrocious folly of this\nproceeding, but it came to my mind as an ingenious move for covering\nour retreat. \n\u0060I don\u0027t know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must be in\nthe absence of man and in a temperate climate. The sun\u0027s heat is rarely\nstrong enough to burn, even when it is focused by dewdrops, as is\nsometimes the case in more tropical districts. Lightning may blast and\nblacken, but it rarely gives rise to widespread fire. Decaying vegetation\nmay occasionally smoulder with the heat of its fermentation, but this\nrarely results in flame. In this decadence, too, the art of fire-making had\nbeen forgotten on the earth. The red tongues that went licking up my\nheap of wood were an altogether new and strange thing to Weena. \n\u0060She wanted to run to it and play with it. I believe she would have cast\nherself into it had I not restrained her. But I caught her up, and, in spite\nof her struggles, plunged boldly before me into the wood. For a little way\nthe glare of my fire lit the path. Looking back presently, I could see,\nthrough the crowded stems, that from my heap of sticks the blaze had\nspread to some bushes adjacent, and a curved line of fire was creeping up\nthe grass of the hill. I laughed at that, and turned again to the dark trees\nbefore me. It was very black, and Weena clung to me convulsively, but\nthere was still, as my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, sufficient\nlight for me to avoid the stems. Overhead it was simply black, except\nwhere a gap of remote blue sky shone down upon us here and there. I\nstruck none of my matches because I had no hand free. Upon my left arm\nI carried my little one, in my right hand I had my iron bar. "},{"pageNumber":80,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 79 -\n\u0060For some way I heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet, the\nfaint rustle of the breeze above, and my own breathing and the throb of\nthe blood-vessels in my ears. Then I seemed to know of a pattering about\nme. I pushed on grimly. The pattering grew more distinct, and then I\ncaught the same queer sounds and voices I had heard in the Underworld.\nThere were evidently several of the Morlocks, and they were closing in\nupon me. Indeed, in another minute I felt a tug at my coat, then\nsomething at my arm. And Weena shivered violently, and became quite\nstill. \n\u0060It was time for a match. But to get one I must put her down. I did so,\nand, as I fumbled with my pocket, a struggle began in the darkness about\nmy knees, perfectly silent on her part and with the same peculiar cooing\nsounds from the Morlocks. Soft little hands, too, were creeping over my\ncoat and back, touching even my neck. Then the match scratched and\nfizzed. I held it flaring, and saw the white backs of the Morlocks in flight\namid the trees. I hastily took a lump of camphor from my pocket, and\nprepared to light is as soon as the match should wane. Then I looked at\nWeena. She was lying clutching my feet and quite motionless, with her\nface to the ground. With a sudden fright I stooped to her. She seemed\nscarcely to breathe. I lit the block of camphor and flung it to the ground,\nand as it spit and flared up and drove back the Morlocks and the\nshadows, I knelt down and lifted her. The wood behind seemed full of\nthe stir and murmur of a great company! \n\u0060She seemed to have fainted. I put her carefully upon my shoulder and\nrose to push on, and then there came a horrible realization. In\nmanoeuvring with my matches and Weena, I had turned myself about\nseveral times, and now I had not the faintest idea in what direction lay\nmy path. For all I knew, I might be facing back towards the Palace of\nGreen Porcelain. I found myself in a cold sweat. I had to think rapidly\nwhat to do. I determined to build a fire and encamp where we were. I put"},{"pageNumber":81,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 80 -\nWeena, still motionless, down upon a turfy bole, and very hastily, as my\nfirst lump of camphor waned, I began collecting sticks and leaves. Here\nand there out of the darkness round me the Morlocks\u0027 eyes shone like\ncarbuncles. \n\u0060The camphor flickered and went out. I lit a match, and as I did so, two\nwhite forms that had been approaching Weena dashed hastily away. One\nwas so blinded by the light that he came straight for me and I felt his\nbones grind under the blow of my fist. He gave a whoop of dismay,\nstaggered a little way, and fell down. I lit another piece of camphor, and\nwent on gathering my bonfire. Presently I noticed how dry was some of\nthe foliage above me, for since my arrival on the Time Machine, a matter\nof a week, no rain had fallen. So, instead of casting about among the\ntrees for fallen twigs, I began leaping up and dragging down branches.\nVery soon I had a choking smoky fire of green wood and dry sticks, and\ncould economize my camphor. Then I turned to where Weena lay beside\nmy iron mace. I tried what I could to revive her, but she lay like one\ndead. I could not even satisfy myself whether or not she breathed. \n\u0060Now, the smoke of the fire beat over towards me, and it must have made\nme heavy of a sudden. Moreover, the vapour of camphor was in the air.\nMy fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so. I felt very weary\nafter my exertion, and sat down. The wood, too, was full of a slumbrous\nmurmur that I did not understand. I seemed just to nod and open my\neyes. But all was dark, and the Morlocks had their hands upon me.\nFlinging off their clinging fingers I hastily felt in my pocket for the\nmatch-box, and--it had gone! Then they gripped and closed with me\nagain. In a moment I knew what had happened. I had slept, and my fire\nhad gone out, and the bitterness of death came over my soul. The forest\nseemed full of the smell of burning wood. I was caught by the neck, by\nthe hair, by the arms, and pulled down. It was indescribably horrible in\nthe darkness to feel all these soft creatures heaped upon me. I felt as if I"},{"pageNumber":82,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 81 -\nwas in a monstrous spider\u0027s web. I was overpowered, and went down. I\nfelt little teeth nipping at my neck. I rolled over, and as I did so my hand\ncame against my iron lever. It gave me strength. I struggled up, shaking\nthe human rats from me, and, holding the bar short, I thrust where I\njudged their faces might be. I could feel the succulent giving of flesh and\nbone under my blows, and for a moment I was free. \n\u0060The strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard fighting\ncame upon me. I knew that both I and Weena were lost, but I determined\nto make the Morlocks pay for their meat. I stood with my back to a tree,\nswinging the iron bar before me. The whole wood was full of the stir and\ncries of them. A minute passed. Their voices seemed to rise to a higher\npitch of excitement, and their movements grew faster. Yet none came\nwithin reach. I stood glaring at the blackness. Then suddenly came hope.\nWhat if the Morlocks were afraid? And close on the heels of that came a\nstrange thing. The darkness seemed to grow luminous. Very dimly I\nbegan to see the Morlocks about me--three battered at my feet--and then\nI recognized, with incredulous surprise, that the others were running, in\nan incessant stream, as it seemed, from behind me, and away through the\nwood in front. And their backs seemed no longer white, but reddish. As I\nstood agape, I saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap of starlight\nbetween the branches, and vanish. And at that I understood the smell of\nburning wood, the slumbrous murmur that was growing now into a gusty\nroar, the red glow, and the Morlocks\u0027 flight. \n\u0060Stepping out from behind my tree and looking back, I saw, through the\nblack pillars of the nearer trees, the flames of the burning forest. It was\nmy first fire coming after me. With that I looked for Weena, but she was\ngone. The hissing and crackling behind me, the explosive thud as each\nfresh tree burst into flame, left little time for reflection. My iron bar still\ngripped, I followed in the Morlocks\u0027 path. It was a close race. Once the\nflames crept forward so swiftly on my right as I ran that I was outflanked"},{"pageNumber":83,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 82 -\nand had to strike off to the left. But at last I emerged upon a small open\nspace, and as I did so, a Morlock came blundering towards me, and past\nme, and went on straight into the fire! \n\u0060And now I was to see the most weird and horrible thing, I think, of all\nthat I beheld in that future age. This whole space was as bright as day\nwith the reflection of the fire. In the centre was a hillock or tumulus,\nsurmounted by a scorched hawthorn. Beyond this was another arm of the\nburning forest, with yellow tongues already writhing from it, completely\nencircling the space with a fence of fire. Upon the hill-side were some\nthirty or forty Morlocks, dazzled by the light and heat, and blundering\nhither and thither against each other in their bewilderment. At first I did\nnot realize their blindness, and struck furiously at them with my bar, in a\nfrenzy of fear, as they approached me, killing one and crippling several\nmore. But when I had watched the gestures of one of them groping under\nthe hawthorn against the red sky, and heard their moans, I was assured of\ntheir absolute helplessness and misery in the glare, and I struck no more\nof them. \n\u0060Yet every now and then one would come straight towards me, setting\nloose a quivering horror that made me quick to elude him. At one time\nthe flames died down somewhat, and I feared the foul creatures would\npresently be able to see me. I was thinking of beginning the fight by\nkilling some of them before this should happen; but the fire burst out\nagain brightly, and I stayed my hand. I walked about the hill among them\nand avoided them, looking for some trace of Weena. But Weena was\ngone. \n\u0060At last I sat down on the summit of the hillock, and watched this strange\nincredible company of blind things groping to and fro, and making\nuncanny noises to each other, as the glare of the fire beat on them. The\ncoiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky, and through the rare"},{"pageNumber":84,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 83 -\ntatters of that red canopy, remote as though they belonged to another\nuniverse, shone the little stars. Two or three Morlocks came blundering\ninto me, and I drove them off with blows of my fists, trembling as I did\nso. \n\u0060For the most part of that night I was persuaded it was a nightmare. I bit\nmyself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake. I beat the ground\nwith my hands, and got up and sat down again, and wandered here and\nthere, and again sat down. Then I would fall to rubbing my eyes and\ncalling upon God to let me awake. Thrice I saw Morlocks put their heads\ndown in a kind of agony and rush into the flames. But, at last, above the\nsubsiding red of the fire, above the streaming masses of black smoke and\nthe whitening and blackening tree stumps, and the diminishing numbers\nof these dim creatures, came the white light of the day. \n\u0060I searched again for traces of Weena, but there were none. It was plain\nthat they had left her poor little body in the forest. I cannot describe how\nit relieved me to think that it had escaped the awful fate to which it\nseemed destined. As I thought of that, I was almost moved to begin a\nmassacre of the helpless abominations about me, but I contained myself.\nThe hillock, as I have said, was a kind of island in the forest. From its\nsummit I could now make out through a haze of smoke the Palace of\nGreen Porcelain, and from that I could get my bearings for the White\nSphinx. And so, leaving the remnant of these damned souls still going\nhither and thither and moaning, as the day grew clearer, I tied some grass\nabout my feet and limped on across smoking ashes and among black\nstems, that still pulsated internally with fire, towards the hiding-place of\nthe Time Machine. I walked slowly, for I was almost exhausted, as well\nas lame, and I felt the intensest wretchedness for the horrible death of\nlittle Weena. It seemed an overwhelming calamity. Now, in this old\nfamiliar room, it is more like the sorrow of a dream than an actual loss.\nBut that morning it left me absolutely lonely again--terribly alone. I"},{"pageNumber":85,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 84 -\nbegan to think of this house of mine, of this fireside, of some of you, and\nwith such thoughts came a longing that was pain. \n\u0060But as I walked over the smoking ashes under the bright morning sky, I\nmade a discovery. In my trouser pocket were still some loose matches.\nThe box must have leaked before it was lost."},{"pageNumber":86,"text":"- 85 -\nThe Time Machine\n10\n- 85 -\n\u0060About eight or nine in the morning I came to the same seat of yellow\nmetal from which I had viewed the world upon the evening of my arrival.\nI thought of my hasty conclusions upon that evening and could not\nrefrain from laughing bitterly at my confidence. Here was the same\nbeautiful scene, the same abundant foliage, the same splendid palaces\nand magnificent ruins, the same silver river running between its fertile\nbanks. The gay robes of the beautiful people moved hither and thither\namong the trees. Some were bathing in exactly the place where I had\nsaved Weena, and that suddenly gave me a keen stab of pain. And like\nblots upon the landscape rose the cupolas above the ways to the\nUnderworld. I understood now what all the beauty of the Upperworld\npeople covered. Very pleasant was their day, as pleasant as the day of the\ncattle in the field. Like the cattle, they knew of no enemies and provided\nagainst no needs. And their end was the same. \n\u0060I grieved to think how brief the dream of the human intellect had been.\nIt had committed suicide. It had set itself steadfastly towards comfort and\nease, a balanced society with security and permanency as its watchword,\nit had attained its hopes--to come to this at last. Once, life and property\nmust have reached almost absolute safety. The rich had been assured of\nhis wealth and comfort, the toiler assured of his life and work. No doubt\nin that perfect world there had been no unemployed problem, no social"},{"pageNumber":87,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 86 -\nquestion left unsolved. And a great quiet had followed. \n\u0060It is a law of nature we overlook, that intellectual versatility is the\ncompensation for change, danger, and trouble. An animal perfectly in\nharmony with its environment is a perfect mechanism. Nature never\nappeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are useless. There is no\nintelligence where there is no change and no need of change. Only those\nanimals partake of intelligence that have to meet a huge variety of needs\nand dangers. \n\u0060So, as I see it, the Upperworld man had drifted towards his feeble\nprettiness, and the Underworld to mere mechanical industry. But that\nperfect state had lacked one thing even for mechanical perfection--\nabsolute permanency. Apparently as time went on, the feeding of the\nUnderworld, however it was effected, had become disjointed. Mother\nNecessity, who had been staved off for a few thousand years, came back\nagain, and she began below. The Underworld being in contact with\nmachinery, which, however perfect, still needs some little thought\noutside habit, had probably retained perforce rather more initiative, if\nless of every other human character, than the upper. And when other\nmeat failed them, they turned to what old habit had hitherto forbidden.\nSo I say I saw it in my last view of the world of Eight Hundred and Two\nThousand Seven Hundred and One. It may be as wrong an explanation as\nmortal wit could invent. It is how the thing shaped itself to me, and as\nthat I give it to you. \n\u0060After the fatigues, excitements, and terrors of the past days, and in spite\nof my grief, this seat and the tranquil view and the warm sunlight were\nvery pleasant. I was very tired and sleepy, and soon my theorizing passed\ninto dozing. Catching myself at that, I took my own hint, and spreading\nmyself out upon the turf I had a long and refreshing sleep. "},{"pageNumber":88,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 87 -\n\u0060I awoke a little before sunsetting. I now felt safe against being caught\nnapping by the Morlocks, and, stretching myself, I came on down the hill\ntowards the White Sphinx. I had my crowbar in one hand, and the other\nhand played with the matches in my pocket. \n\u0060And now came a most unexpected thing. As I approached the pedestal\nof the sphinx I found the bronze valves were open. They had slid down\ninto grooves. \n\u0060At that I stopped short before them, hesitating to enter. \n\u0060Within was a small apartment, and on a raised place in the corner of this\nwas the Time Machine. I had the small levers in my pocket. So here,\nafter all my elaborate preparations for the siege of the White Sphinx, was\na meek surrender. I threw my iron bar away, almost sorry not to use it. \n\u0060A sudden thought came into my head as I stooped towards the portal.\nFor once, at least, I grasped the mental operations of the Morlocks.\nSuppressing a strong inclination to laugh, I stepped through the bronze\nframe and up to the Time Machine. I was surprised to find it had been\ncarefully oiled and cleaned. I have suspected since that the Morlocks had\neven partially taken it to pieces while trying in their dim way to grasp its\npurpose. \n\u0060Now as I stood and examined it, finding a pleasure in the mere touch of\nthe contrivance, the thing I had expected happened. The bronze panels\nsuddenly slid up and struck the frame with a clang. I was in the dark--\ntrapped. So the Morlocks thought. At that I chuckled gleefully. \n\u0060I could already hear their murmuring laughter as they came towards me."},{"pageNumber":89,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 88 -\nVery calmly I tried to strike the match. I had only to fix on the levers and\ndepart then like a ghost. But I had overlooked one little thing. The\nmatches were of that abominable kind that light only on the box. \n\u0060You may imagine how all my calm vanished. The little brutes were\nclose upon me. One touched me. I made a sweeping blow in the dark at\nthem with the levers, and began to scramble into the saddle of the\nmachine. Then came one hand upon me and then another. Then I had\nsimply to fight against their persistent fingers for my levers, and at the\nsame time feel for the studs over which these fitted. One, indeed, they\nalmost got away from me. As it slipped from my hand, I had to butt in\nthe dark with my head--I could hear the Morlock\u0027s skull ring--to recover\nit. It was a nearer thing than the fight in the forest, I think, this last\nscramble. \n\u0060But at last the lever was fitted and pulled over. The clinging hands\nslipped from me. The darkness presently fell from my eyes. I found\nmyself in the same grey light and tumult I have already described."},{"pageNumber":90,"text":"- 89 -\nThe Time Machine\n11\n- 89 -\n\u0060I have already told you of the sickness and confusion that comes with\ntime travelling. And this time I was not seated properly in the saddle, but\nsideways and in an unstable fashion. For an indefinite time I clung to the\nmachine as it swayed and vibrated, quite unheeding how I went, and\nwhen I brought myself to look at the dials again I was amazed to find\nwhere I had arrived. One dial records days, another thousands of days,\nanother millions of days, and another thousands of millions. Now,\ninstead of reversing the levers, I had pulled them over so as to go\nforward with them, and when I came to look at these indicators I found\nthat the thousands hand was sweeping round as fast as the seconds hand\nof a watch--into futurity. \n\u0060As I drove on, a peculiar change crept over the appearance of things.\nThe palpitating greyness grew darker; then--though I was still travelling\nwith prodigious velocity--the blinking succession of day and night,\nwhich was usually indicative of a slower pace, returned, and grew more\nand more marked. This puzzled me very much at first. The alternations\nof night and day grew slower and slower, and so did the passage of the\nsun across the sky, until they seemed to stretch through centuries. At last\na steady twilight brooded over the earth, a twilight only broken now and\nthen when a comet glared across the darkling sky. The band of light that\nhad indicated the sun had long since disappeared; for the sun had ceased"},{"pageNumber":91,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 90 -\nto set--it simply rose and fell in the west, and grew ever broader and\nmore red. All trace of the moon had vanished. The circling of the stars,\ngrowing slower and slower, had given place to creeping points of light.\nAt last, some time before I stopped, the sun, red and very large, halted\nmotionless upon the horizon, a vast dome glowing with a dull heat, and\nnow and then suffering a momentary extinction. At one time it had for a\nlittle while glowed more brilliantly again, but it speedily reverted to its\nsullen red heat. I perceived by this slowing down of its rising and setting\nthat the work of the tidal drag was done. The earth had come to rest with\none face to the sun, even as in our own time the moon faces the earth.\nVery cautiously, for I remembered my former headlong fall, I began to\nreverse my motion. Slower and slower went the circling hands until the\nthousands one seemed motionless and the daily one was no longer a mere\nmist upon its scale. Still slower, until the dim outlines of a desolate beach\ngrew visible. \n\u0060I stopped very gently and sat upon the Time Machine, looking round.\nThe sky was no longer blue. North-eastward it was inky black, and out of\nthe blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale white stars. Overhead\nit was a deep Indian red and starless, and south-eastward it grew brighter\nto a glowing scarlet where, cut by the horizon, lay the huge hull of the\nsun, red and motionless. The rocks about me were of a harsh reddish\ncolour, and all the trace of life that I could see at first was the intensely\ngreen vegetation that covered every projecting point on their south-\neastern face. It was the same rich green that one sees on forest moss or\non the lichen in caves: plants which like these grow in a perpetual\ntwilight. \n\u0060The machine was standing on a sloping beach. The sea stretched away\nto the south-west, to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the wan sky.\nThere were no breakers and no waves, for not a breath of wind was\nstirring. Only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a gentle breathing, and"},{"pageNumber":92,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 91 -\nshowed that the eternal sea was still moving and living. And along the\nmargin where the water sometimes broke was a thick incrustation of salt-\n-pink under the lurid sky. There was a sense of oppression in my head,\nand I noticed that I was breathing very fast. The sensation reminded me\nof my only experience of mountaineering, and from that I judged the air\nto be more rarefied than it is now. \n\u0060Far away up the desolate slope I heard a harsh scream, and saw a thing\nlike a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into the sky and,\ncircling, disappear over some low hillocks beyond. The sound of its\nvoice was so dismal that I shivered and seated myself more firmly upon\nthe machine. Looking round me again, I saw that, quite near, what I had\ntaken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving slowly towards me. Then\nI saw the thing was really a monstrous crab-like creature. Can you\nimagine a crab as large as yonder table, with its many legs moving\nslowly and uncertainly, its big claws swaying, its long antenn, like\ncarters\u0027 whips, waving and feeling, and its stalked eyes gleaming at you\non either side of its metallic front? Its back was corrugated and\nornamented with ungainly bosses, and a greenish incrustation blotched it\nhere and there. I could see the many palps of its complicated mouth\nflickering and feeling as it moved. \n\u0060As I stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me, I felt a\ntickling on my cheek as though a fly had lighted there. I tried to brush it\naway with my hand, but in a moment it returned, and almost immediately\ncame another by my ear. I struck at this and caught something threadlike.\nIt was drawn swiftly out of my hand. With a frightful qualm, I turned,\nand I saw that I had grasped the antenna of another monster crab that\nstood just behind me. Its evil eyes were wriggling on their stalks, its\nmouth was all alive with appetite, and its vast ungainly claws, smeared\nwith an algal slime, were descending upon me. In a moment my hand\nwas on the lever, and I had placed a month between myself and these"},{"pageNumber":93,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 92 -\nmonsters. But I was still on the same beach, and I saw them distinctly\nnow as soon as I stopped. Dozens of them seemed to be crawling here\nand there, in the sombre light, among the foliated sheets of intense green. \n\u0060I cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over the\nworld. The red eastern sky, the northward blackness, the salt Dead Sea,\nthe stony beach crawling with these foul, slow-stirring monsters, the\nuniform poisonous-looking green of the lichenous plants, the thin air that\nhurts one\u0027s lungs; all contributed to an appalling effect. I moved on a\nhundred years, and there was the same red sun--a little larger, a little\nduller--the same dying sea, the same chill air, and the same crowd of\nearthy crustacea creeping in and out among the green weed and the red\nrocks. And in the westward sky I saw a curved pale line like a vast new\nmoon. \n\u0060So I travelled, stopping ever and again, in great strides of a thousand\nyears or more, drawn on by the mystery of the earth\u0027s fate, watching with\na strange fascination the sun grow larger and duller in the westward sky,\nand the life of the old earth ebb away. At last, more than thirty million\nyears hence, the huge red-hot dome of the sun had come to obscure\nnearly a tenth part of the darkling heavens. Then I stopped once more,\nfor the crawling multitude of crabs had disappeared, and the red beach,\nsave for its livid green liverworts and lichens, seemed lifeless. And now\nit was flecked with white. A bitter cold assailed me. Rare white flakes\never and again came eddying down. To the north-eastward, the glare of\nsnow lay under the starlight of the sable sky, and I could see an\nundulating crest of hillocks pinkish white. There were fringes of ice\nalong the sea margin, with drifting masses further out; but the main\nexpanse of that salt ocean, all bloody under the eternal sunset, was still\nunfrozen. \n\u0060I looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained. A certain"},{"pageNumber":94,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 93 -\nindefinable apprehension still kept me in the saddle of the machine. But I\nsaw nothing moving, in earth or sky or sea. The green slime on the rocks\nalone testified that life was not extinct. A shallow sand-bank had\nappeared in the sea and the water had receded from the beach. I fancied I\nsaw some black object flopping about upon this bank, but it became\nmotionless as I looked at it, and I judged that my eye had been deceived,\nand that the black object was merely a rock. The stars in the sky were\nintensely bright and seemed to me to twinkle very little. \n\u0060Suddenly I noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun had\nchanged; that a concavity, a bay, had appeared in the curve. I saw this\ngrow larger. For a minute perhaps I stared aghast at this blackness that\nwas creeping over the day, and then I realized that an eclipse was\nbeginning. Either the moon or the planet Mercury was passing across the\nsun\u0027s disk. Naturally, at first I took it to be the moon, but there is much to\nincline me to believe that what I really saw was the transit of an inner\nplanet passing very near to the earth. \n\u0060The darkness grew apace; a cold wind began to blow in freshening gusts\nfrom the east, and the showering white flakes in the air increased in\nnumber. From the edge of the sea came a ripple and whisper. Beyond\nthese lifeless sounds the world was silent. Silent? It would be hard to\nconvey the stillness of it. All the sounds of man, the bleating of sheep,\nthe cries of birds, the hum of insects, the stir that makes the background\nof our lives--all that was over. As the darkness thickened, the eddying\nflakes grew more abundant, dancing before my eyes; and the cold of the\nair more intense. At last, one by one, swiftly, one after the other, the\nwhite peaks of the distant hills vanished into blackness. The breeze rose\nto a moaning wind. I saw the black central shadow of the eclipse\nsweeping towards me. In another moment the pale stars alone were\nvisible. All else was rayless obscurity. The sky was absolutely black. "},{"pageNumber":95,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 94 -\n\u0060A horror of this great darkness came on me. The cold, that smote to my\nmarrow, and the pain I felt in breathing, overcame me. I shivered, and a\ndeadly nausea seized me. Then like a red-hot bow in the sky appeared the\nedge of the sun. I got off the machine to recover myself. I felt giddy and\nincapable of facing the return journey. As I stood sick and confused I\nsaw again the moving thing upon the shoal--there was no mistake now\nthat it was a moving thing--against the red water of the sea. It was a\nround thing, the size of a football perhaps, or, it may be, bigger, and\ntentacles trailed down from it; it seemed black against the weltering\nblood-red water, and it was hopping fitfully about. Then I felt I was\nfainting. But a terrible dread of lying helpless in that remote and awful\ntwilight sustained me while I clambered upon the saddle."},{"pageNumber":96,"text":"- 95 -\nThe Time Machine\n12\n- 95 -\n\u0060So I came back. For a long time I must have been insensible upon the\nmachine. The blinking succession of the days and nights was resumed,\nthe sun got golden again, the sky blue. I breathed with greater freedom.\nThe fluctuating contours of the land ebbed and flowed. The hands spun\nbackward upon the dials. At last I saw again the dim shadows of houses,\nthe evidences of decadent humanity. These, too, changed and passed, and\nothers came. Presently, when the million dial was at zero, I slackened\nspeed. I began to recognize our own petty and familiar architecture, the\nthousands hand ran back to the starting-point, the night and day flapped\nslower and slower. Then the old walls of the laboratory came round me.\nVery gently, now, I slowed the mechanism down.\n\u0060I saw one little thing that seemed odd to me. I think I have told you that\nwhen I set out, before my velocity became very high, Mrs. Watchett had\nwalked across the room, travelling, as it seemed to me, like a rocket. As I\nreturned, I passed again across that minute when she traversed the\nlaboratory. But now her every motion appeared to be the exact inversion\nof her previous ones. The door at the lower end opened, and she glided\nquietly up the laboratory, back foremost, and disappeared behind the\ndoor by which she had previously entered. Just before that I seemed to\nsee Hillyer for a moment; but he passed like a flash."},{"pageNumber":97,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 96 -\n\u0060Then I stopped the machine, and saw about me again the old familiar\nlaboratory, my tools, my appliances just as I had left them. I got off the\nthing very shakily, and sat down upon my bench. For several minutes I\ntrembled violently. Then I became calmer. Around me was my old\nworkshop again, exactly as it had been. I might have slept there, and the\nwhole thing have been a dream.\n\u0060And yet, not exactly! The thing had started from the south-east corner of\nthe laboratory. It had come to rest again in the north-west, against the\nwall where you saw it. That gives you the exact distance from my little\nlawn to the pedestal of the White Sphinx, into which the Morlocks had\ncarried my machine.\n\u0060For a time my brain went stagnant. Presently I got up and came through\nthe passage here, limping, because my heel was still painful, and feeling\nsorely begrimed. I saw the Pall Mall Gazette on the table by the door. I\nfound the date was indeed to-day, and looking at the timepiece, saw the\nhour was almost eight o\u0027clock. I heard your voices and the clatter of\nplates. I hesitated--I felt so sick and weak. Then I sniffed good\nwholesome meat, and opened the door on you. You know the rest. I\nwashed, and dined, and now I am telling you the story.\n\u0060I know,\u0027 he said, after a pause, \u0060that all this will be absolutely incredible\nto you. To me the one incredible thing is that I am here to-night in this\nold familiar room looking into your friendly faces and telling you these\nstrange adventures.\u0027 \nHe looked at the Medical Man. \u0060No. I cannot expect you to believe it.\nTake it as a lie--or a prophecy. Say I dreamed it in the workshop.\nConsider I have been speculating upon the destinies of our race until I\nhave hatched this fiction.

And taking it as a story, what do you think\nof it?\u0027 \nHe took up his pipe, and began, in his old accustomed manner, to tap\nwith it nervously upon the bars of the grate. There was a momentary\nstillness. Then chairs began to creak and shoes to scrape upon the carpet.\nI took my eyes off the Time Traveller\u0027s face, and looked round at his\naudience. They were in the dark, and little spots of colour swam before\nthem. The Medical Man seemed absorbed in the contemplation of our\nhost. The Editor was looking hard at the end of his cigar--the sixth. The\nJournalist fumbled for his watch. The others, as far as I remember, were\nmotionless. \nThe Editor stood up with a sigh. \u0060What a pity it is you\u0027re not a writer of\nstories!\u0027 he said, putting his hand on the Time Traveller\u0027s shoulder. \n\u0060You don\u0027t believe it?\u0027 \n\u0060Well--\u0027 \n\u0060I thought not.\u0027 \nThe Time Traveller turned to us. \u0060Where are the matches?\u0027 he said. He lit\none and spoke over his pipe, puffing. \u0060To tell you the truth...I hardly\nbelieve it myself.... And yet...\u0027 \nHis eye fell with a mute inquiry upon the withered white flowers upon\nthe little table. Then he turned over the hand holding his pipe, and I saw\nhe was looking at some half-healed scars on his knuckles. "},{"pageNumber":99,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 98 -\nThe Medical Man rose, came to the lamp, and examined the flowers.\n\u0060The gynceum\u0027s odd,\u0027 he said. The Psychologist leant forward to see,\nholding out his hand for a specimen. \n\u0060I\u0027m hanged if it isn\u0027t a quarter to one,\u0027 said the Journalist. \u0060How shall we\nget home?\u0027 \n\u0060Plenty of cabs at the station,\u0027 said the Psychologist. \n\u0060It\u0027s a curious thing,\u0027 said the Medical Man; \u0060but I certainly don\u0027t know\nthe natural order of these flowers. May I have them?\u0027 \nThe Time Traveller hesitated. Then suddenly: \u0060Certainly not.\u0027 \n\u0060Where did you really get them?\u0027 said the Medical Man. \nThe Time Traveller put his hand to his head. He spoke like one who was\ntrying to keep hold of an idea that eluded him. \u0027They were put into my\npocket by Weena, when I travelled into Time.\u0027 He stared round the room.\n\u0060I\u0027m damned if it isn\u0027t all going. This room and you and the atmosphere\nof every day is too much for my memory. Did I ever make a Time\nMachine, or a model of a Time Machine? Or is it all only a dream? They\nsay life is a dream, a precious poor dream at times--but I can\u0027t stand\nanother that won\u0027t fit. It\u0027s madness. And where did the dream come\nfrom?... I must look at that machine. If there is one!\u0027 \nHe caught up the lamp swiftly, and carried it, flaring red, through the\ndoor into the corridor. We followed him.

I\u0027m sorry to have brought you out here in the cold.\u0027 He took up\nthe lamp, and, in an absolute silence, we returned to the smoking-room. \nHe came into the hall with us and helped the Editor on with his coat. The\nMedical Man looked into his face and, with a certain hesitation, told him\nhe was suffering from overwork, at which he laughed hugely. I\nremember him standing in the open doorway, bawling good night. \nI shared a cab with the Editor. He thought the tale a \u0060gaudy lie.\u0027 For my\nown part I was unable to come to a conclusion. The story was so\nfantastic and incredible, the telling so credible and sober. I lay awake\nmost of the night thinking about it. I determined to go next day and see\nthe Time Traveller again. I was told he was in the laboratory, and being\non easy terms in the house, I went up to him. The laboratory, however,\nwas empty. I stared for a minute at the Time Machine and put out my\nhand and touched the lever. At that the squat substantial-looking mass\nswayed like a bough shaken by the wind. Its instability startled me\nextremely, and I had a queer reminiscence of the childish days when I\nused to be forbidden to meddle. I came back through the corridor. The\nTime Traveller met me in the smoking-room. He was coming from the\nhouse. He had a small camera under one arm and a knapsack under the\nother. He laughed when he saw me, and gave me an elbow to shake. \u0060I\u0027m\nfrightfully busy,\u0027 said he, \u0060with that thing in there.\u0027 \n\u0060But is it not some hoax?\u0027 I said. \u0060Do you really travel through time?\u0027 "},{"pageNumber":101,"text":"The Time Machine H. G. Wells\n- 100 -\n\u0060Really and truly I do.\u0027 And he looked frankly into my eyes. He hesitated.\nHis eye wandered about the room. \u0060I only want half an hour,\u0027 he said. \u0060I\nknow why you came, and it\u0027s awfully good of you. There\u0027s some\nmagazines here. If you\u0027ll stop to lunch I\u0027ll prove you this time travelling\nup to the hilt, specimen and all. If you\u0027ll forgive my leaving you now?\u0027 \nI consented, hardly comprehending then the full import of his words, and\nhe nodded and went on down the corridor. I heard the door of the\nlaboratory slam, seated myself in a chair, and took up a daily paper.\nWhat was he going to do before lunch-time? Then suddenly I was\nreminded by an advertisement that I had promised to meet Richardson,\nthe publisher, at two. I looked at my watch, and saw that I could barely\nsave that engagement. I got up and went down the passage to tell the\nTime Traveller. \nAs I took hold of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation, oddly\ntruncated at the end, and a click and a thud. A gust of air whirled round\nme as I opened the door, and from within came the sound of broken glass\nfalling on the floor. The Time Traveller was not there. I seemed to see a\nghostly, indistinct figure sitting in a whirling mass of black and brass for\na moment--a figure so transparent that the bench behind with its sheets of\ndrawings was absolutely distinct; but this phantasm vanished as I rubbed\nmy eyes. The Time Machine had gone. Save for a subsiding stir of dust,\nthe further end of the laboratory was empty. A pane of the skylight had,\napparently, just been blown in.\nI felt an unreasonable amazement. I knew that something strange had\nhappened, and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange\nthing might be. As I stood staring, the door into the garden opened, and\nthe man-servant appeared."},{"pageNumber":102,"text":"H. G. Wells The Time Machine\n- 101 -\nWe looked at each other. Then ideas began to come. \u0060Has Mr.-- gone out\nthat way?\u0027 said I.\n\u0060No, sir. No one has come out this way. I was expecting to find him\nhere.\u0027\nAt that I understood. At the risk of disappointing Richardson I stayed on,\nwaiting for the Time Traveller; waiting for the second, perhaps still\nstranger story, and the specimens and photographs he would bring with\nhim. But I am beginning now to fear that I must wait a lifetime. The\nTime Traveller vanished three years ago. And, as everybody knows now,\nhe has never returned."},{"pageNumber":103,"text":"- 102 -\nThe Time Machine\nEpilogue\n- 102 -\nOne cannot choose but wonder. Will he ever return? It may be that he\nswept back into the past, and fell among the blood-drinking, hairy\nsavages of the Age of Unpolished Stone; into the abysses of the\nCretaceous Sea; or among the grotesque saurians, the huge reptilian\nbrutes of the Jurassic times. He may even now--if I may use the phrase--\nbe wandering on some plesiosaurus-haunted Oolitic coral reef, or beside\nthe lonely saline lakes of the Triassic Age. Or did he go forward, into one\nof the nearer ages, in which men are still men, but with the riddles of our\nown time answered and its wearisome problems solved? Into the\nmanhood of the race: for I, for my own part, cannot think that these latter\ndays of weak experiment, fragmentary theory, and mutual discord are\nindeed man\u0027s culminating time! I say, for my own part. He, I know--for\nthe question had been discussed among us long before the Time Machine\nwas made--thought but cheerlessly of the Advancement of Mankind, and\nsaw in the growing pile of civilisation only a foolish heaping that must\ninevitably fall back upon and destroy its makers in the end. If that is so, it\nremains for us to live as though it were not so. But to me the future is\nstill black and blank--is a vast ignorance, lit at a few casual places by the\nmemory of his story. And I have by me, for my comfort, two strange\nwhite flowers--shrivelled now, and brown and flat and brittle--to witness\nthat even when mind and strength had gone, gratitude and a mutual\ntenderness still lived on in the heart of man."}]
