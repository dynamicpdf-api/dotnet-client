For\ninstance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at fifteen,\nanother at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. All these are\nevidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional representations of his\nFour-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and unalterable thing. \n\u0060Scientific people,\u0027 proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause\nrequired for the proper assimilation of this, \u0060know very well that Time is\nonly a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram, a weather\nrecord. This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of the\nbarometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then this\nmorning it rose again, and so gently upward to here. Surely the mercury\ndid not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Space generally\nrecognized? But certainly it traced such a line, and that line, therefore,\nwe must conclude was along the Time-Dimension.\u0027 \n\u0060But,\u0027 said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, \u0060if Time is\nreally only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why has it always\nbeen, regarded as something different? And why cannot we move in\nTime as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?\u0027 \nThe Time Traveller smiled. \u0060Are you sure we can move freely in Space?\nRight and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough, and men\nalways have done so. I admit we move freely in two dimensions. But\nhow about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.\u0027 \n\u0060Not exactly,\u0027 said the Medical Man. \u0060There are balloons.\u0027 \n\u0060But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the\ninequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical movement.\u0027 "
